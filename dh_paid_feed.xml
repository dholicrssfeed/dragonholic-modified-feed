Junseong is stuck in a world that feels like an endless loop, much like a roguelike game. It’s a cursed world where he struggles every day. Two months have passed since he set foot in the zombie apocalypse world in his dreams. “Ha….” As soon as he woke up, his gaze was instinctively drawn to the internet broadcast that he habitually left on. -A major riot is occurring in some regions due to the current situation… Then, beep! A loud sound announcing a disaster alert echoed in Junseong’s head. Unconsciously picking up his phone along with the alarm sound, Junseong couldn’t hide his confused expression.<br/> [10:44 AM] It was the exact time he had always woken up in his dream. Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. “I’ve been wanting to ask you something.”<br/> “What?” As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo’s gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. “Why do you look at me like that?” Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. “How am I… looking at you?”<br/> “….” Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the ‘fake smile’ he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his ‘clothes’ but emanated from him.“</p> </div>]]></description>

The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. “Why do you look at me like that?” Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. “How am I… looking at you?”<br/> “….” Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the ‘fake smile’ he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his ‘clothes’ but emanated from him.“</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>“Every day, a recurring hellish dream. Junseong is stuck in a world that feels like an endless loop, much like a roguelike game. It’s a cursed world where he struggles every day. Two months have passed since he set foot in the zombie apocalypse world in his dreams. “Ha….” As soon as he woke up, his gaze was instinctively drawn to the internet broadcast that he habitually left on. -A major riot is occurring in some regions due to the current situation… Then, beep! A loud sound announcing a disaster alert echoed in Junseong’s head. Unconsciously picking up his phone along with the alarm sound, Junseong couldn’t hide his confused expression.<br/> [10:44 AM] It was the exact time he had always woken up in his dream. Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. “I’ve been wanting to ask you something.”<br/> “What?” As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo’s gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. “Why do you look at me like that?” Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. “How am I… looking at you?”<br/> “….” Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the ‘fake smile’ he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his ‘clothes’ but emanated from him.“</p> </div>]]></description>

She stole her fiancé, harmed her birth mother, and ruthlessly pulled her down from the heavens. Laughing arrogantly, she sneered, “How can a mere woman from the feudal era ever compete with a modern woman of the 21st century?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Schemes and trickery altered her predestined fate, a pregnant belly destroyed her marriage prospects, and she was forced to marry a spoiled and troublemaking son of a noble, who brought ruin upon her on her supposed wedding night. And yet, by some strange twist of fate, it inadvertently led her to the most extraordinary encounter with her fated one.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">A crazy monk once read her fortune: a great calamity at the coming of age, a great joy at the age of twenty, and a great sorrow in old age.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shen Guiyan did not believe in fate. She only believed that with human determination, one could even overcome destiny.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those who took from her, she would make sure they would pay! Those who harmed her, she would make sure they would burn in the pits of hell! </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">So what if you have traveled through time? So what if you have been reborn?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if you have eight or ten golden fingers**, I would chop them all up for you!</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would be coming for you, no matter what!</span></p> <p> </p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*born with Phoenix Jade in her mouth – this symbolizes a noble or auspicious birth, often implying destiny, luck, or even divine favor.</span></i></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">**golden fingers – Chinese slang for cheat-like powers, or supernatural advantages</span></i></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><a href="https://ko-fi.com/P5P51F06QW" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Buy Me a Coffee at ko-fi.com" border="0" decoding="async" height="36" src="https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi4.png?v=6" style="border: 0px;height: 36px"/></a></p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the tender age of five, Shen Guiyan could recite the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Thousand Character Classic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> from memory; at the age of six, she could already play guqin and even composed her own melodies; at the age of seven, she could write a full poem and finish it in the brief time it took for the incense stick to burn; and by the time she turned eight, she was already betrothed to the son of the Prime Minister.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone said that she was born with Phoenix Jade* in her mouth— destined for greatness from the very start.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, fate took a cruel turn.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">A woman from the modern era arrived and transformed Shen Guiyan’s once-brash younger sister into someone sharp and clever. She stole her fiancé, harmed her birth mother, and ruthlessly pulled her down from the heavens. Laughing arrogantly, she sneered, “How can a mere woman from the feudal era ever compete with a modern woman of the 21st century?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Schemes and trickery altered her predestined fate, a pregnant belly destroyed her marriage prospects, and she was forced to marry a spoiled and troublemaking son of a noble, who brought ruin upon her on her supposed wedding night. And yet, by some strange twist of fate, it inadvertently led her to the most extraordinary encounter with her fated one.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">A crazy monk once read her fortune: a great calamity at the coming of age, a great joy at the age of twenty, and a great sorrow in old age.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shen Guiyan did not believe in fate. She only believed that with human determination, one could even overcome destiny.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those who took from her, she would make sure they would pay! Those who harmed her, she would make sure they would burn in the pits of hell! </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">So what if you have traveled through time? So what if you have been reborn?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if you have eight or ten golden fingers**, I would chop them all up for you!</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would be coming for you, no matter what!</span></p> <p> </p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*born with Phoenix Jade in her mouth – this symbolizes a noble or auspicious birth, often implying destiny, luck, or even divine favor.</span></i></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">**golden fingers – Chinese slang for cheat-like powers, or supernatural advantages</span></i></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><a href="https://ko-fi.com/P5P51F06QW" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Buy Me a Coffee at ko-fi.com" border="0" decoding="async" height="36" src="https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi4.png?v=6" style="border: 0px;height: 36px"/></a></p> </div>]]></description>

She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky. It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.</p> <p>But what happened to her in the end?</p> <p>For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.</p> <p>If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.</p> <p>Who knew he’d be reborn again…</p> <p>When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky.

The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. “Why do you look at me like that?” Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. “How am I… looking at you?”<br/> “….” Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the ‘fake smile’ he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his ‘clothes’ but emanated from him.“</p> </div>]]></description>

She stole her fiancé, harmed her birth mother, and ruthlessly pulled her down from the heavens. Laughing arrogantly, she sneered, “How can a mere woman from the feudal era ever compete with a modern woman of the 21st century?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Schemes and trickery altered her predestined fate, a pregnant belly destroyed her marriage prospects, and she was forced to marry a spoiled and troublemaking son of a noble, who brought ruin upon her on her supposed wedding night. And yet, by some strange twist of fate, it inadvertently led her to the most extraordinary encounter with her fated one.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">A crazy monk once read her fortune: a great calamity at the coming of age, a great joy at the age of twenty, and a great sorrow in old age.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shen Guiyan did not believe in fate. She only believed that with human determination, one could even overcome destiny.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those who took from her, she would make sure they would pay! Those who harmed her, she would make sure they would burn in the pits of hell! </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">So what if you have traveled through time? So what if you have been reborn?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if you have eight or ten golden fingers**, I would chop them all up for you!</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would be coming for you, no matter what!</span></p> <p> </p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*born with Phoenix Jade in her mouth – this symbolizes a noble or auspicious birth, often implying destiny, luck, or even divine favor.</span></i></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">**golden fingers – Chinese slang for cheat-like powers, or supernatural advantages</span></i></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><a href="https://ko-fi.com/P5P51F06QW" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Buy Me a Coffee at ko-fi.com" border="0" decoding="async" height="36" src="https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi4.png?v=6" style="border: 0px;height: 36px"/></a></p> </div>]]></description>
