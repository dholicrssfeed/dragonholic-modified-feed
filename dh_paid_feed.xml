      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.</p> <p>After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor’s chest: “Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?”<br/> The new emperor kissed her: “You will be fine, just love me.”<br/> The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: “Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left.”</p> <p>When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess’s obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official’s wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.</p> <p>Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.<br/> ——</p> <p>The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.</p> <p>Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.</p> <p>For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, “The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated,” before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. <span class="censored" data-replacement="Oybbq">Bl00d</span> poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.</p> <p>Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: “Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?”</p> <p>“… She resigned.

I have waited for this day.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan’s ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> And Ning Yao’s lifelong wish is to ascend.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span> <span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:</span></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?”</span></i></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft—those fools don’t know his worth. He’s from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.”</span></i></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it works, great. If not… well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.”</span></i></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions. When that happens, their instincts will turn against their beloved, giving rise to an uncontrollable urge to kill.</span></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Slay one’s beloved, attain enlightenment, ascend immediately, and forget the past.</span></i></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">A perfect outcome for both.</span></i></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ning Yao knew that Feng Jingzhuo had already begun to grow his heart’s scales.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, he endured the agonizing pain, hiding away to claw open his own chest. He ripped out the endlessly growing scales, pinned his own hands down with bone nails—desperately resisting his dragon instincts.</span></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yao Yao, don’t come in…”</span></i></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“I beg you… whatever you do, don’t come in…”</span></i></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’ll be over soon. Be good. Stay outside…”</span></i></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Outside, Ning Yao pondered, if</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> we can both ascend, that’s better than neither of us ascending at all.</span></i></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, she went in.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as she always did, she held him in her arms, kissing his trembling, pale lips with tenderness.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">After many 10 thousand years, Ning Yao was reborn and successfully ascended.</span></p> <p>She forgot Feng Jingzhou, but he remembered her.</p> <p>Tormenting himself, he wanted to turn back time.</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ning Yao was very happy, but the ceremony of conferring the gods was a little simple.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because the entire world of gods was busy trying to stop a fallen god who wants to activate the forbidden Time-Reversal Array.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span> <span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Theme: My heart is controlled by me, not by heavens.</span></p> <p> </p> </div>]]></description>

Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband’s demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.<br/> Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”<br/> Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to. Who told me to marry you— I’m going to be a powerful minister. I can’t fall here.”<br/> Helan Ci, “Then do your best! I’m counting on you!”<br/> Lu Wuyou, “…?”</p> <p>Years later, Lu Wuyou became the Prime Minister, holding the highest position among officials, wielding immense power across the land, and reflecting on the past.</p> <p>A student asked him how he had come this far.</p> <p>Prime Minister Lu thought to himself that as long as one marries a wife of extraordinary beauty, often coveted by others, it would always inspire one to strive to make progress.</p> <p>=====</p> <p>Two chapters will be free every week (Sat &amp; Sunday).</p> <p>If you enjoy this story consider rate and review this at NovelUpdates, also support me at ko-fi</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.</p> <p>After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor’s chest: “Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?”<br/> The new emperor kissed her: “You will be fine, just love me.”<br/> The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: “Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left.”</p> <p>When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess’s obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official’s wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.</p> <p>Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.<br/> ——</p> <p>The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.</p> <p>Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.</p> <p>For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, “The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated,” before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. <span class="censored" data-replacement="Oybbq">Bl00d</span> poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.</p> <p>Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: “Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?”</p> <p>“… She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore.”</p> <p>Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: “She said she won’t fight, so the fight is over?”</p> <hr/> <p>If you’re enjoying the story, please consider:</p> <ol> <li>Supporting the author</li> <li>Rating or leaving a review on <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/after-rebirth-i-married-my-archenemy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NovelUpdates</a>!</li> </ol> <p>If you spot any mistakes in my translation, feel free to DM me on Discord (KatTL) or report it at <a href="https://discord.gg/FWwrYycV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragonholic Discord server</a>.</p> <p><strong>Release schedule:</strong> 1 chapter will be unlocked every 3 days. 1-2 advance chapters will be updated only on weekdays.</p> <hr/> <p>If you enjoy my translations and want to sprinkle a little joy in my cup, you can treat me to a coffee on Ko-fi or support me at Patreon!
