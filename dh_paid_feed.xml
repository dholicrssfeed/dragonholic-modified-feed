      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.</p> <p>Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.</p> <p>Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.</p> <p>The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…</p> <p>The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.</p> <p>That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.</p> <hr/> <p>Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.</p> <p>At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.</p> <p>He could smile, she realised, but not for her.</p> <p>From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.</p> <p>Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.</p> <hr/> <p>After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.</p> <p>But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.</p> <p>On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”</p> <p>Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.</p> <p>For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.</p> </div>]]></description>

She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.</p> <p>After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor’s chest: “Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?”<br/> The new emperor kissed her: “You will be fine, just love me.”<br/> The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: “Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left.”</p> <p>When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess’s obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official’s wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.</p> <p>Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.<br/> ——</p> <p>The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.</p> <p>Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.</p> <p>For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, “The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated,” before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. <span class="censored" data-replacement="Oybbq">Bl00d</span> poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.</p> <p>Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: “Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?”</p> <p>“… She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore.”</p> <p>Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: “She said she won’t fight, so the fight is over?”</p> <hr/> <p>If you’re enjoying the story, please consider:</p> <ol> <li>Supporting the author</li> <li>Rating or leaving a review on <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/after-rebirth-i-married-my-archenemy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NovelUpdates</a>!</li> </ol> <p>If you spot any mistakes in my translation, feel free to DM me on Discord (KatTL) or report it at <a href="https://discord.gg/FWwrYycV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragonholic Discord server</a>.</p> <p><strong>Release schedule:</strong> 1 chapter will be unlocked every 3 days. 1-2 advance chapters will be updated only on weekdays.</p> <hr/> <p>If you enjoy my translations and want to sprinkle a little joy in my cup, you can treat me to a coffee on Ko-fi or support me at Patreon!

I have waited for this day.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan’s ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> And Ning Yao’s lifelong wish is to ascend.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span> <span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:</span></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?”</span></i></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft—those fools don’t know his worth. He’s from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.”</span></i></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it works, great. If not… well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.”</span></i></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions. When that happens, their instincts will turn against their beloved, giving rise to an uncontrollable urge to kill.</span></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Slay one’s beloved, attain enlightenment, ascend immediately, and forget the past.</span></i></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">A perfect outcome for both.</span></i></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ning Yao knew that Feng Jingzhuo had already begun to grow his heart’s scales.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, he endured the agonizing pain, hiding away to claw open his own chest.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.</p> <p>After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor’s chest: “Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?”<br/> The new emperor kissed her: “You will be fine, just love me.”<br/> The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: “Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left.”</p> <p>When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess’s obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official’s wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.</p> <p>Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.<br/> ——</p> <p>The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.</p> <p>Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.</p> <p>For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, “The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated,” before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. <span class="censored" data-replacement="Oybbq">Bl00d</span> poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.</p> <p>Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: “Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?”</p> <p>“… She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore.”</p> <p>Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: “She said she won’t fight, so the fight is over?”</p> <hr/> <p>If you’re enjoying the story, please consider:</p> <ol> <li>Supporting the author</li> <li>Rating or leaving a review on <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/after-rebirth-i-married-my-archenemy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NovelUpdates</a>!</li> </ol> <p>If you spot any mistakes in my translation, feel free to DM me on Discord (KatTL) or report it at <a href="https://discord.gg/FWwrYycV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragonholic Discord server</a>.</p> <p><strong>Release schedule:</strong> 1 chapter will be unlocked every 3 days. 1-2 advance chapters will be updated only on weekdays.</p> <hr/> <p>If you enjoy my translations and want to sprinkle a little joy in my cup, you can treat me to a coffee on Ko-fi or support me at Patreon!

She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, “I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early.”</p> <p>After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.</p> <p>One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: “I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce.”</p> <p>Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: “I’ve already graduated.”</p> <p>“So?”</p> <p>“I want to have a child.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>General Qi Ren, known as the “Mad Wolf” was once an undefeated war god.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>“Trias Marigold is innocent. I’ll prove it.”<br/> In the world of Flower Mail, every person is born with an inherent talent for a specific job. A young man bearing the Demon Lord job is subjugated and arrested, accused of plotting world conquest.</p> <p>Freya Blossom, an eccentric lawyer from the Lotus Federation specializing in criminal cases, firmly believes in Demon Lord Trias Marigold’s innocence. Against the prevailing prejudice that all Demon Lords are evil, Freya diligently gathers evidence. Gradually revealed is a distorted world system, one that fears the “omnipotent Demon Lord possessing the power of all jobs” and maintains balance by branding him as evil.</p> <p>People cannot choose their job abilities. Discriminated against simply for being born a Demon Lord, Trias is falsely accused of a mass murder committed by a band of thieves. To further incriminate him, a fabricated confession of his intent to conquer the world is produced.</p> <p>By gaining the support of one of the heroes, who is vaguely aware of the truth and plagued by guilt, Freya succeeds in overturning the trial and rescuing Trias.</p> <p>Trias joins the law firm operated by Freya and her paralegal partner, Techno. And so begins their boisterous and bright new life together in the office.</p> </div>]]></description>
