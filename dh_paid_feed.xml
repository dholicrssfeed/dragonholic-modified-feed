      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>“Trias Marigold is innocent. I’ll prove it.”<br/> In the world of Flower Mail, every person is born with an inherent talent for a specific job. A young man bearing the Demon Lord job is subjugated and arrested, accused of plotting world conquest.</p> <p>Freya Blossom, an eccentric lawyer from the Lotus Federation specializing in criminal cases, firmly believes in Demon Lord Trias Marigold’s innocence. Against the prevailing prejudice that all Demon Lords are evil, Freya diligently gathers evidence. Gradually revealed is a distorted world system, one that fears the “omnipotent Demon Lord possessing the power of all jobs” and maintains balance by branding him as evil.</p> <p>People cannot choose their job abilities. Discriminated against simply for being born a Demon Lord, Trias is falsely accused of a mass murder committed by a band of thieves. To further incriminate him, a fabricated confession of his intent to conquer the world is produced.</p> <p>By gaining the support of one of the heroes, who is vaguely aware of the truth and plagued by guilt, Freya succeeds in overturning the trial and rescuing Trias.</p> <p>Trias joins the law firm operated by Freya and her paralegal partner, Techno. And so begins their boisterous and bright new life together in the office.</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>“Trias Marigold is innocent. I’ll prove it.”<br/> In the world of Flower Mail, every person is born with an inherent talent for a specific job. A young man bearing the Demon Lord job is subjugated and arrested, accused of plotting world conquest.</p> <p>Freya Blossom, an eccentric lawyer from the Lotus Federation specializing in criminal cases, firmly believes in Demon Lord Trias Marigold’s innocence. Against the prevailing prejudice that all Demon Lords are evil, Freya diligently gathers evidence. Gradually revealed is a distorted world system, one that fears the “omnipotent Demon Lord possessing the power of all jobs” and maintains balance by branding him as evil.</p> <p>People cannot choose their job abilities. Discriminated against simply for being born a Demon Lord, Trias is falsely accused of a mass murder committed by a band of thieves. To further incriminate him, a fabricated confession of his intent to conquer the world is produced.</p> <p>By gaining the support of one of the heroes, who is vaguely aware of the truth and plagued by guilt, Freya succeeds in overturning the trial and rescuing Trias.</p> <p>Trias joins the law firm operated by Freya and her paralegal partner, Techno. And so begins their boisterous and bright new life together in the office.</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing’an Marquis’s residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle’s family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke’s residence was snatched away by her stepsister.</p> <p>After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.</p> <p>The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.</p> <p>This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.</p> <p>The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.</p> <p>To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.</p> <p>However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.</p> <p>When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.</p> <p>The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.</p> <p>It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.</p> <p>She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.</p> <p>While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.</p> <p>Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!</p> <p>————</p> <p>At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.</p> <p>At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.</p> <p>The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.</p> <p>Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.</p> <p>And all the girl asked for in return was—</p> <p>“Sister, kiss me.”</p> <p>“Sister, hug me.”</p> <p>“Sister, cuddle me.”</p> <p>The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.</p> <p>Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl’s “concubine” while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.</p> <p>————</p> <p>Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.</p> <p>Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.</p> <p>“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”</p> <p>Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—</p> </div>]]></description>
