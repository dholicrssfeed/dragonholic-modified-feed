      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Shin Jisoo is an ordinary woman in her thirties, but her life is a mess. Work is stressful, people are tiring, and now she even has to stop drinking. Feeling desperate, she goes to a shaman. But the shaman says something strange:</p> <p><i>“You’re in for huge bad luck. Really big trouble.”</i><i></i></p> <p>To stop this bad luck, Jisoo must meet a “big man.” It sounds silly— but then she really meets him. Chae Juwon is handsome and too charming to trust.</p> <p>“I’ll tell you now— I don’t know why you’re here, but I’m not interested. I never sleep with people the old man sets me up with.”<i></i></p> <p>Juwon is bold and sly. He shocks Jisoo the first time they meet. And by accident, she finds out that the “big” rumor about him is true.</p> <p>“So, did you get my number just to try it out?”<i></i></p> <p>Jisoo just wants a quiet life, but Juwon keeps pulling her into trouble. Still, in this mess, she finds new chances and feelings she can’t ignore.</p> <p>“Why are you so kind to me, Mr. Chae?”</p> <p>“I don’t know. I just want to be kind to you, Ms. Shin.”</p> <p>As her biggest problem gets closer, this man keeps showing up. Can Jisoo really grab her “big luck” — or will it run away again?</p> </div>]]></description>
