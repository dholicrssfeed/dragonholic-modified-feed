      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Gu Yu Qi, a daughter born to a marquis household. She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky. It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.</p> <p>But what happened to her in the end?</p> <p>For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.</p> <p>If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.</p> <p>Who knew he’d be reborn again…</p> <p>When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky. Just what are you playing at!?</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the tender age of five, Shen Guiyan could recite the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Thousand Character Classic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> from memory; at the age of six, she could already play guqin and even composed her own melodies; at the age of seven, she could write a full poem and finish it in the brief time it took for the incense stick to burn; and by the time she turned eight, she was already betrothed to the son of the Prime Minister.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone said that she was born with Phoenix Jade* in her mouth— destined for greatness from the very start.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, fate took a cruel turn.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">A woman from the modern era arrived and transformed Shen Guiyan’s once-brash younger sister into someone sharp and clever. She stole her fiancé, harmed her birth mother, and ruthlessly pulled her down from the heavens. Laughing arrogantly, she sneered, “How can a mere woman from the feudal era ever compete with a modern woman of the 21st century?”</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Schemes and trickery altered her predestined fate, a pregnant belly destroyed her marriage prospects, and she was forced to marry a spoiled and troublemaking son of a noble, who brought ruin upon her on her supposed wedding night. And yet, by some strange twist of fate, it inadvertently led her to the most extraordinary encounter with her fated one.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">A crazy monk once read her fortune: a great calamity at the coming of age, a great joy at the age of twenty, and a great sorrow in old age.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shen Guiyan did not believe in fate. She only believed that with human determination, one could even overcome destiny.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those who took from her, she would make sure they would pay! Those who harmed her, she would make sure they would burn in the pits of hell! </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">So what if you have traveled through time? So what if you have been reborn?</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if you have eight or ten golden fingers**, I would chop them all up for you!</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would be coming for you, no matter what!</span></p> <p> </p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*born with Phoenix Jade in her mouth – this symbolizes a noble or auspicious birth, often implying destiny, luck, or even divine favor.</span></i></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">**golden fingers – Chinese slang for cheat-like powers, or supernatural advantages</span></i></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> </div>]]></description>
