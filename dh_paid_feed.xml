She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky. It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.</p> <p>But what happened to her in the end?</p> <p>For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.</p> <p>If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.</p> <p>Who knew he’d be reborn again…</p> <p>When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky. Just what are you playing at!?</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>At the princess’s banquet, in a secluded hall, Helan Ci pressed her palm against the wall, encountering the equally disheveled newly crowned top scholar Lu Wuyou. One was as delicate as a willow, the other had a flushed face.</p> <p>Their eyes met, and in each other’s gaze, they saw a glimmer of despair.<br/> “I’ll go first…”<br/> “I’ll head that way…”</p> <p>However, what was even more despairing was the sound of the princess’s maid and the second prince’s attendant searching for them not far away.<br/> Helan Ci bit her lip: “What don’t you just go to the princess?”<br/> Lu Wuyou endured: “I think the second prince is not bad either.”<br/> Helan Ci: “If we keep talking, we’ll only end up hurting each other!”<br/> Lu Wuyou closed his eyes: “Then let it be a mutual destruction.”<br/> Helan Ci: “…?”</p> <p>A night later, their innocence was lost, and they were forced into marriage. Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband’s demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.<br/> Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”<br/> Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to. Who told me to marry you— I’m going to be a powerful minister. I can’t fall here.”<br/> Helan Ci, “Then do your best! I’m counting on you!”<br/> Lu Wuyou, “…?”</p> <p>Years later, Lu Wuyou became the Prime Minister, holding the highest position among officials, wielding immense power across the land, and reflecting on the past.</p> <p>A student asked him how he had come this far.</p> <p>Prime Minister Lu thought to himself that as long as one marries a wife of extraordinary beauty, often coveted by others, it would always inspire one to strive to make progress.</p> <p>=====</p> <p>Two chapters will be free every week (Sat &amp; Sunday).</p> <p>If you enjoy this story consider rate and review this at NovelUpdates, also support me at ko-fi</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> </div>]]></description>

Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband’s demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.<br/> Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”<br/> Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to. Who told me to marry you— I’m going to be a powerful minister. I can’t fall here.”<br/> Helan Ci, “Then do your best! I’m counting on you!”<br/> Lu Wuyou, “…?”</p> <p>Years later, Lu Wuyou became the Prime Minister, holding the highest position among officials, wielding immense power across the land, and reflecting on the past.</p> <p>A student asked him how he had come this far.</p> <p>Prime Minister Lu thought to himself that as long as one marries a wife of extraordinary beauty, often coveted by others, it would always inspire one to strive to make progress.</p> <p>=====</p> <p>Two chapters will be free every week (Sat &amp; Sunday).</p> <p>If you enjoy this story consider rate and review this at NovelUpdates, also support me at ko-fi</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> </div>]]></description>
