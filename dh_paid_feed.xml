      <title>Giving Interstellar Players a Horror Ghost Game Shock</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!</p> <p>What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!</p> <p>With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!</p> <p>She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”</p> <p>She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”</p> <p>She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”</p> <p>Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”</p> <p>Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”</p> <p> </p> <hr/> <p>If you’re enjoying the story, please consider:</p> <ol> <li>Supporting the author</li> <li>Rating or leaving a review on <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/giving-interstellar-players-a-horror-ghost-game-shock/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NovelUpdates</a>!</li> </ol> <p>If you spot any mistakes in my translation, feel free to DM me on Discord (KatTL) or report it at <a href="https://discord.gg/FWwrYycV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragonholic Discord server</a>.</p> <p> </p> <hr/> <p>If you enjoy my translations and want to sprinkle a little joy in my cup, you can treat me to a coffee on Ko-fi or support me at Patreon!
