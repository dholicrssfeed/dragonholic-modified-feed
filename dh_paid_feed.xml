      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Summary One:<br/> The unshakable number one idol of the music world, Jing Yuan, had never shown her face once in twelve years since her debut. The year she announced her retirement was also the year Lu Zhao began to shine.</p> <p>On the day Lu Zhao won Best Singer of the Year, the media couldn’t wait to crown her as the “New Number One Idol in Music.” The topic trended for three days straight, and the two fanbases fought endlessly online.</p> <p>Not long after, the official announcement stated that Jing Yuan would return and make a public appearance. Everyone speculated that Lu Zhao, from the same company, had threatened her position.</p> <p>On the day of the live-streamed press conference, Jing Yuan made her first appearance with black hair and a red dress, stunning and seductive.</p> <p>Just as people were marveling at her beauty, a bold reporter asked, “Ms. Jing Yuan, do you have anything to say to your junior colleague Lu Zhao?”</p> <p>Jing Yuan smiled meaningfully, paused for a few seconds, then said, “I hope she comes home on time tonight.”</p> <p>Right after those words, the livestream lagged and the internet exploded. Tags like #JingYuanSuspectedToBeDatingLuZhao and #JingYuan+LuZhao shot to the top of the trending list.</p> <p>No one knew the top idol Jing Yuan’s real name was Sheng Jingyu.</p> <p>No one knew her gland was congenitally underdeveloped, and she couldn’t smell any Alpha pheromones.</p> <p>Even fewer knew that Lu Zhao was the only Alpha whose scent Sheng Jingyu could perceive.</p> <p>Summary Two:<br/> The first time Lu Zhao met Sheng Jingyu, she was drinking alone in a booth for two.<br/> With black hair over her shoulders and a thin dress hanging off them, she looked strikingly unique in the decadent bar.</p> <p>She was completely drunk. Clearly, she had only retired from her idol career, yet she looked like a pitiful, abandoned drunk Alpha, even pulling off her own inhibitor patch.</p> <p>The second time Lu Zhao saw her, she was sitting in the garden of an old house, using sign language to explain that she was her co-renting roommate.</p> <p>Only then did Lu Zhao realize that the beautiful Omega she once called boring couldn’t speak.</p> <p>Sheng Jingyu claimed she had been a musician before losing her voice, so Lu Zhao often asked her for guidance.</p> <p>Under her mentorship, Lu Zhao improved rapidly, but she always felt something was off.</p> <p>Were they standing too close?</p> <p>Did her hand really need to stay on her own lower abdomen?</p> <p>If she moved higher, wouldn’t she be touching her gland?!</p> <p>…</p> <p>Before Lu Zhao could figure anything out, Sheng Jingyu’s inhibitors stopped working due to her gland issue.</p> <p>In a room filled with the weak scent of green grape and absinthe, Lu Zhao was guided into giving her first-ever temporary mark.</p> <p>Later, Lu Zhao found the notebook Sheng Jingyu used to communicate before learning sign language.</p> <p>She realized the handwriting was identical to the autographed copy she had collected from a Jing Yuan fan special.</p> </div>]]></description>
