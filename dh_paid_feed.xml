      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Male Lead:</strong> <em>Kang Tae-shin</em> — owner of 4, Cheonghae-dong 118-gil. His work is as unusual as his mysterious aura.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Female Lead:</strong> <em>Woo Seula</em> — her life turned upside down after a sudden outbreak on her skin. While desperately looking for a cure, she crosses paths with Kang Taeshin.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>When to Read:</strong> When you want a romantic comedy wrapped up in exorcism and fate.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Story Intro</strong></p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Woo Seula’s whole body suddenly breaks out in a rash, and no doctor can explain. After trying everything she can think of, she finally goes to see a shaman — and finds out what she has is called Mudoo.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Following the shaman’s instructions, she heads to Cheonghae-dong 118-gil 4 — and that’s where she meets a man named Kang Tae-shin.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Seula, I’d like you to help me with my work.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t work at night. I’m a morning person — I need to stick to a routine and be active during the day.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Three days from now. Ten at night. Come to Cheonghae-dong.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">She thought he was just some weirdo — but after meeting him, the Mudoo clears up completely, and her body feels light again.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Except… now she’s seeing things she shouldn’t be seeing — and panic sets in.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Is it really that scary, seeing what’s in front of you?”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“…Can’t you make it so I don’t see them again?”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Just pretend you don’t see, don’t hear, don’t feel anything. Act exactly like you did before your third eye opened.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">A man whose true nature is a mystery — Kang Tae-shin — and Donggil, a talking dog who claims he’s a spirit.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Living with them, Seula has no choice but to exorcise ghosts — in this strange, chilly story full of secrets.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Still, if you ever get too scared… come to me.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“…”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Tonight, I’ll come pick you up.”</p> </div>]]></description>

Work is stressful, people are tiring, and now she even has to stop drinking. Feeling desperate, she goes to a shaman. But the shaman says something strange:</p> <p><i>“You’re in for huge bad luck.

Chae Juwon is handsome and too charming to trust.</p> <p>“I’ll tell you now— I don’t know why you’re here, but I’m not interested. I never sleep with people the old man sets me up with.”<i></i></p> <p>Juwon is bold and sly. He shocks Jisoo the first time they meet. And by accident, she finds out that the “big” rumor about him is true.</p> <p>“So, did you get my number just to try it out?”<i></i></p> <p>Jisoo just wants a quiet life, but Juwon keeps pulling her into trouble.

Tags like #JingYuanSuspectedToBeDatingLuZhao and #JingYuan+LuZhao shot to the top of the trending list.</p> <p>No one knew the top idol Jing Yuan’s real name was Sheng Jingyu.</p> <p>No one knew her gland was congenitally underdeveloped, and she couldn’t smell any Alpha pheromones.</p> <p>Even fewer knew that Lu Zhao was the only Alpha whose scent Sheng Jingyu could perceive.</p> <p>Summary Two:<br/> The first time Lu Zhao met Sheng Jingyu, she was drinking alone in a booth for two.<br/> With black hair over her shoulders and a thin dress hanging off them, she looked strikingly unique in the decadent bar.</p> <p>She was completely drunk. Clearly, she had only retired from her idol career, yet she looked like a pitiful, abandoned drunk Alpha, even pulling off her own inhibitor patch.</p> <p>The second time Lu Zhao saw her, she was sitting in the garden of an old house, using sign language to explain that she was her co-renting roommate.</p> <p>Only then did Lu Zhao realize that the beautiful Omega she once called boring couldn’t speak.</p> <p>Sheng Jingyu claimed she had been a musician before losing her voice, so Lu Zhao often asked her for guidance.</p> <p>Under her mentorship, Lu Zhao improved rapidly, but she always felt something was off.</p> <p>Were they standing too close?</p> <p>Did her hand really need to stay on her own lower abdomen?</p> <p>If she moved higher, wouldn’t she be touching her gland?!</p> <p>…</p> <p>Before Lu Zhao could figure anything out, Sheng Jingyu’s inhibitors stopped working due to her gland issue.</p> <p>In a room filled with the weak scent of green grape and absinthe, Lu Zhao was guided into giving her first-ever temporary mark.</p> <p>Later, Lu Zhao found the notebook Sheng Jingyu used to communicate before learning sign language.</p> <p>She realized the handwriting was identical to the autographed copy she had collected from a Jing Yuan fan special.</p> </div>]]></description>

Work is stressful, people are tiring, and now she even has to stop drinking. Feeling desperate, she goes to a shaman. But the shaman says something strange:</p> <p><i>“You’re in for huge bad luck. Really big trouble.”</i><i></i></p> <p>To stop this bad luck, Jisoo must meet a “big man.” It sounds silly— but then she really meets him. Chae Juwon is handsome and too charming to trust.</p> <p>“I’ll tell you now— I don’t know why you’re here, but I’m not interested. I never sleep with people the old man sets me up with.”<i></i></p> <p>Juwon is bold and sly. He shocks Jisoo the first time they meet. And by accident, she finds out that the “big” rumor about him is true.</p> <p>“So, did you get my number just to try it out?”<i></i></p> <p>Jisoo just wants a quiet life, but Juwon keeps pulling her into trouble. Still, in this mess, she finds new chances and feelings she can’t ignore.</p> <p>“Why are you so kind to me, Mr. Chae?”</p> <p>“I don’t know. I just want to be kind to you, Ms. Shin.”</p> <p>As her biggest problem gets closer, this man keeps showing up.

When she woke up, she found herself transported into a romance novel, becoming the self-conscious and sensitive female lead.</p> <p>The original character was a student at Nanchuan City No. 1 High School with average grades but secretly in love with the male lead, Zhang Ye. This caused the female supporting characters in the book to viciously slander her and even bully her at school. Among them, the one who hated the original character the most was the wealthy heiress Jiang Xianzhi.</p> <p>After enduring persecution from her family, a series of school bullying incidents, and a physically and emotionally abusive relationship with the male lead, the original character finally achieved a happy ending with him.</p> <p>Thinking about the original plot, Zhou Yining almost laughed in anger.

It was her senior year, and clearly, the teachers hadn’t assigned enough homework if there was still time for this useless romantic nonsense.</p> <p>Zhou Yining tore the original plot apart. She studied hard, aiming to top every subject. She rejected her family’s moral manipulation, gathered evidence to send those who bullied the original character to justice, and kicked the male lead, who loved to act cool for no reason, to the curb.</p> <p>As she fought her way forward, she realized that the rich girl who used to hate her was actually kind of cute.

When she woke up, she found herself transported into a romance novel, becoming the self-conscious and sensitive female lead.</p> <p>The original character was a student at Nanchuan City No. 1 High School with average grades but secretly in love with the male lead, Zhang Ye. This caused the female supporting characters in the book to viciously slander her and even bully her at school.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Summary One:<br/> The unshakable number one idol of the music world, Jing Yuan, had never shown her face once in twelve years since her debut. The year she announced her retirement was also the year Lu Zhao began to shine.</p> <p>On the day Lu Zhao won Best Singer of the Year, the media couldn’t wait to crown her as the “New Number One Idol in Music.” The topic trended for three days straight, and the two fanbases fought endlessly online.</p> <p>Not long after, the official announcement stated that Jing Yuan would return and make a public appearance.

Work is stressful, people are tiring, and now she even has to stop drinking. Feeling desperate, she goes to a shaman. But the shaman says something strange:</p> <p><i>“You’re in for huge bad luck. Really big trouble.”</i><i></i></p> <p>To stop this bad luck, Jisoo must meet a “big man.” It sounds silly— but then she really meets him. Chae Juwon is handsome and too charming to trust.</p> <p>“I’ll tell you now— I don’t know why you’re here, but I’m not interested. I never sleep with people the old man sets me up with.”<i></i></p> <p>Juwon is bold and sly. He shocks Jisoo the first time they meet. And by accident, she finds out that the “big” rumor about him is true.</p> <p>“So, did you get my number just to try it out?”<i></i></p> <p>Jisoo just wants a quiet life, but Juwon keeps pulling her into trouble. Still, in this mess, she finds new chances and feelings she can’t ignore.</p> <p>“Why are you so kind to me, Mr. Chae?”</p> <p>“I don’t know. I just want to be kind to you, Ms. Shin.”</p> <p>As her biggest problem gets closer, this man keeps showing up.

Born as an illegitimate child of a chaebol family, he’s made his name in the shadows but is left with nothing but the reputation of being human trash.

His work is as unusual as his mysterious aura.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Female Lead:</strong> <em>Woo Seula</em> — her life turned upside down after a sudden outbreak on her skin. While desperately looking for a cure, she crosses paths with Kang Taeshin.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>When to Read:</strong> When you want a romantic comedy wrapped up in exorcism and fate.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Story Intro</strong></p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Woo Seula’s whole body suddenly breaks out in a rash, and no doctor can explain. After trying everything she can think of, she finally goes to see a shaman — and finds out what she has is called Mudoo.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Following the shaman’s instructions, she heads to Cheonghae-dong 118-gil 4 — and that’s where she meets a man named Kang Tae-shin.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Seula, I’d like you to help me with my work.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t work at night. I’m a morning person — I need to stick to a routine and be active during the day.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Three days from now. Ten at night. Come to Cheonghae-dong.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">She thought he was just some weirdo — but after meeting him, the Mudoo clears up completely, and her body feels light again.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Except… now she’s seeing things she shouldn’t be seeing — and panic sets in.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Is it really that scary, seeing what’s in front of you?”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“…Can’t you make it so I don’t see them again?”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Just pretend you don’t see, don’t hear, don’t feel anything. Act exactly like you did before your third eye opened.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">A man whose true nature is a mystery — Kang Tae-shin — and Donggil, a talking dog who claims he’s a spirit.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Living with them, Seula has no choice but to exorcise ghosts — in this strange, chilly story full of secrets.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Still, if you ever get too scared… come to me.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“…”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Tonight, I’ll come pick you up.”</p> </div>]]></description>
