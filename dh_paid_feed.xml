After trying everything she can think of, she finally goes to see a shaman — and finds out what she has is called Mudoo.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Following the shaman’s instructions, she heads to Cheonghae-dong 118-gil 4 — and that’s where she meets a man named Kang Tae-shin.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Seula, I’d like you to help me with my work.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t work at night. I’m a morning person — I need to stick to a routine and be active during the day.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Three days from now. Ten at night. Come to Cheonghae-dong.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">She thought he was just some weirdo — but after meeting him, the Mudoo clears up completely, and her body feels light again.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Except… now she’s seeing things she shouldn’t be seeing — and panic sets in.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Is it really that scary, seeing what’s in front of you?”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“…Can’t you make it so I don’t see them again?”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Just pretend you don’t see, don’t hear, don’t feel anything. Act exactly like you did before your third eye opened.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">A man whose true nature is a mystery — Kang Tae-shin — and Donggil, a talking dog who claims he’s a spirit.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Living with them, Seula has no choice but to exorcise ghosts — in this strange, chilly story full of secrets.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Still, if you ever get too scared… come to me.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“…”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Tonight, I’ll come pick you up.”</p> </div>]]></description>
