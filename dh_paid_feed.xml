Born as an illegitimate child of a chaebol family, he’s made his name in the shadows but is left with nothing but the reputation of being human trash. With no hope left in life, he drifts through each day in dull indifference.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Female Lead:</strong></p> <p style="font-weight: 400"><strong><em>Irang</em></strong> – The hidden child of a district attorney famous for his integrity.
