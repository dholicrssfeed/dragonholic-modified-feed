      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!</p> <p>What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!</p> <p>With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!</p> <p>She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”</p> <p>She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”</p> <p>She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”</p> <p>Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy.

      <title>Giving Interstellar Players a Horror Ghost Game Shock</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!</p> <p>What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!</p> <p>With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!</p> <p>She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”</p> <p>She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”</p> <p>She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier?

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.</p> <p>After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor’s chest: “Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?”<br/> The new emperor kissed her: “You will be fine, just love me.”<br/> The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: “Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left.”</p> <p>When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess’s obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official’s wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.</p> <p>Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.<br/> ——</p> <p>The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.</p> <p>Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.</p> <p>For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, “The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated,” before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. <span class="censored" data-replacement="Oybbq">Bl00d</span> poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.</p> <p>Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: “Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?”</p> <p>“… She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore.”</p> <p>Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: “She said she won’t fight, so the fight is over?”</p> <hr/> <p>If you’re enjoying the story, please consider:</p> <ol> <li>Supporting the author</li> <li>Rating or leaving a review on <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/after-rebirth-i-married-my-archenemy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NovelUpdates</a>!</li> </ol> <p>If you spot any mistakes in my translation, feel free to DM me on Discord (KatTL) or report it at <a href="https://discord.gg/FWwrYycV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragonholic Discord server</a>.</p> <p><strong>Release schedule:</strong> 1 chapter will be unlocked every 3 days. 1-2 advance chapters will be updated only on weekdays.</p> <hr/> <p>If you enjoy my translations and want to sprinkle a little joy in my cup, you can treat me to a coffee on Ko-fi or support me at Patreon!
