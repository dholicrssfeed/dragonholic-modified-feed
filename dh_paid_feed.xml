      <title>The Young Marquis Regrets Too Late</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.</p> <p>Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.</p> <p>Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.</p> <p>The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…</p> <p>The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.</p> <p>That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.</p> <hr/> <p>Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.</p> <p>At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.</p> <p>He could smile, she realised, but not for her.</p> <p>From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.</p> <p>Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.</p> <hr/> <p>After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.</p> <p>But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.</p> <p>On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”</p> <p>Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.</p> <p>For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.</p> </div>]]></description>
