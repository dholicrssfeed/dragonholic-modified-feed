During a famine, the original host scams food and drink in the city, committing all sorts of evil deeds. With an innocent and harmless face, she tricks the distressed Jiang Jinhuang into marrying her. After the marriage, the original host’s true nature is revealed. When Jiang Jinhuang refuses to consummate the marriage, the host relentlessly pressures and torments her, even nearly strangling Jiang Jinhuang’s younger sister to death. After enduring countless hardships, Jiang Jinhuang finally returns to the capital, where her family and childhood friend deal with the original host, whose final destination is a mass grave outside the city.</p> <p>Ye Qing, having received the entire plot, plans to stay far away from Jiang Jinhuang and live well in this ancient world. But just as she prepares to leave, her personal system activates, unlocking the spatial ability from her previous life. Unlike before, her space now includes land and a spiritual spring. The system tells her that by earning Jiang Jinhuang’s favor, she can gain rewards to ensure she won’t starve during the famine.</p> <p>Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 potato seeds;<br/> Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with a 2-pound carp;<br/> Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 eggs…</p> <p>Through her efforts, Ye Qing helps Jiang Jinhuang and her sister thrive during the famine.

After many struggles, she reaches Linzhou but fails to find her relatives. Lost and desperate, she believes Ye Qing’s words and temporarily marries her. However, after the marriage, Ye Qing becomes a different person, constantly abusing her. Then, one day, Ye Qing suddenly changes for the better, protecting Jiang Jinhuang and her sister, ensuring they never go hungry. Later, Ye Qing even escorts them back to the capital. When Ye Qing tries to leave, Jiang Jinhuang blocks the door, her fox-like eyes staring at Ye Qing with an unreadable expression, saying, “Where do you think you’re going, abandoning me?”</p> <p>|Qianyuan = Alpha, Kunze = Omega, Zhongyong = Beta|</p> <p>Content Tags: Personal Space, Sweet Story, Book Transmigration, Feel-Good Story, ABO, Stockpiling</p> <p>One-Sentence Summary: Living well and eating heartily in a famine novel~</p> <p>Theme: Change your fate through effort and gain a positive life.</p> </div>]]></description>
