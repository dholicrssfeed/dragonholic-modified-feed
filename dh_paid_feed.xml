      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Shin Jisoo is an ordinary woman in her thirties, but her life is a mess. Work is stressful, people are tiring, and now she even has to stop drinking. Feeling desperate, she goes to a shaman. But the shaman says something strange:</p> <p><i>“You’re in for huge bad luck. Really big trouble.”</i><i></i></p> <p>To stop this bad luck, Jisoo must meet a “big man.” It sounds silly— but then she really meets him. Chae Juwon is handsome and too charming to trust.</p> <p>“I’ll tell you now— I don’t know why you’re here, but I’m not interested. I never sleep with people the old man sets me up with.”<i></i></p> <p>Juwon is bold and sly. He shocks Jisoo the first time they meet. And by accident, she finds out that the “big” rumor about him is true.</p> <p>“So, did you get my number just to try it out?”<i></i></p> <p>Jisoo just wants a quiet life, but Juwon keeps pulling her into trouble. Still, in this mess, she finds new chances and feelings she can’t ignore.</p> <p>“Why are you so kind to me, Mr. Chae?”</p> <p>“I don’t know. I just want to be kind to you, Ms. Shin.”</p> <p>As her biggest problem gets closer, this man keeps showing up. Can Jisoo really grab her “big luck” — or will it run away again?</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Gu Yu Qi, a daughter born to a marquis household. She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky. It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.</p> <p>But what happened to her in the end?</p> <p>For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.</p> <p>If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.</p> <p>Who knew he’d be reborn again…</p> <p>When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky. Just what are you playing at!?</p> </div>]]></description>

His work is as unusual as his mysterious aura.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Female Lead:</strong> <em>Woo Seula</em> — her life turned upside down after a sudden outbreak on her skin. While desperately looking for a cure, she crosses paths with Kang Taeshin.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>When to Read:</strong> When you want a romantic comedy wrapped up in exorcism and fate.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Story Intro</strong></p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Woo Seula’s whole body suddenly breaks out in a rash, and no doctor can explain. After trying everything she can think of, she finally goes to see a shaman — and finds out what she has is called Mudoo.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Following the shaman’s instructions, she heads to Cheonghae-dong 118-gil 4 — and that’s where she meets a man named Kang Tae-shin.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Seula, I’d like you to help me with my work.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t work at night. I’m a morning person — I need to stick to a routine and be active during the day.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Three days from now. Ten at night. Come to Cheonghae-dong.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">She thought he was just some weirdo — but after meeting him, the Mudoo clears up completely, and her body feels light again.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Except… now she’s seeing things she shouldn’t be seeing — and panic sets in.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Is it really that scary, seeing what’s in front of you?”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“…Can’t you make it so I don’t see them again?”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Just pretend you don’t see, don’t hear, don’t feel anything. Act exactly like you did before your third eye opened.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">A man whose true nature is a mystery — Kang Tae-shin — and Donggil, a talking dog who claims he’s a spirit.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Living with them, Seula has no choice but to exorcise ghosts — in this strange, chilly story full of secrets.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Still, if you ever get too scared… come to me.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“…”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Tonight, I’ll come pick you up.”</p> </div>]]></description>
