      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Gu Yu Qi, a daughter born to a marquis household. She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky. It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.</p> <p>But what happened to her in the end?</p> <p>For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.</p> <p>If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.</p> <p>Who knew he’d be reborn again…</p> <p>When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky. Just what are you playing at!?</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Ani belongs to a nearly extinct species with unparalleled mimicry abilities.</p> <p>In order to survive, she joins the infamous interstellar live-streamed hunting game, taking on the form of a seemingly ordinary human girl—wide-eyed, innocent, and sweetly smiling.</p> <p>No one expects such a fragile-looking human to last more than three days.</p> <p>Yet, as the months pass, the audience watches in growing horror. Not only has this delicate girl survived, but she has fought her way into the finals. The once-dominant warriors, who were the center of attention, now flinch at the mere mention of her name, instinctively retreating as if facing their natural predator.</p> <p>——————————</p> <p>Ani bears the heavy responsibility of continuing her species. She is the last of her kind.</p> <p>To ensure her race’s survival, she must seek out the strongest and most exceptional beings across the universe to reproduce with.</p> <p>While her opponents view her as an enemy in a life-or-death battle, Ani has already begun her own special hunt.</p> <p>Within her hunting grounds, <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> turns sweet, pain transforms into pleasure, and slaughter weaves an inescapable web of desire.</p> <p>And those caught in her web? They become hers—completely.</p> <p>——————————</p> <p>At some point, the prey began to come to her willingly.</p> <p>A man who was once formidable and battle-hardened, grasps her hand, and pressed it against his abdomen, willingly giving up his body for her to alter. He, who once struck fear across the battlefield, now stands before her with an almost desperate plea.</p> <p>His voice is low, uncertain, yet filled with expectation.</p> <p>“Ani… You will take responsibility right?”</p> <p>——————————</p> <p><strong>Reader Advisory</strong></p> <p><strong>[Suggestive Content Alert!]</strong></p> <p>•Technically not smut, but it’s not really suggested for U-18 either!!!</p> <p>•Tentacle protagonist, male pregnancy.</p> <p>•Niche themes, self-indulgent writing—proceed with caution if not your cup of tea.</p> </div>]]></description>
