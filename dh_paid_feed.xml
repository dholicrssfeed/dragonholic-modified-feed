      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Gu Yu Qi, a daughter born to a marquis household. She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky. It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.</p> <p>But what happened to her in the end?</p> <p>For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn‚Äôt too late to change her fate.</p> <p>If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman‚Äôs ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.</p> <p>Who knew he‚Äôd be reborn again‚Ä¶</p> <p>When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky. Just what are you playing at!?</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ning Yao died tragically.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> The man she had saved and cared for for many years despised her and shattered her spirit veins with his own hands and dissolved her body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ning Yao: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‚ÄúThank you. I have waited for this day.‚Äù </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan‚Äôs ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> And Ning Yao‚Äôs lifelong wish is to ascend.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span> <span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:</span></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‚ÄúYao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?‚Äù</span></i></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft‚Äîthose fools don‚Äôt know his worth. He‚Äôs from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.‚Äù</span></i></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‚ÄúIf it works, great. If not‚Ä¶ well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.‚Äù</span></i></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions. When that happens, their instincts will turn against their beloved, giving rise to an uncontrollable urge to kill.</span></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Slay one‚Äôs beloved, attain enlightenment, ascend immediately, and forget the past.</span></i></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">A perfect outcome for both.</span></i></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ning Yao knew that Feng Jingzhuo had already begun to grow his heart‚Äôs scales.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, he endured the agonizing pain, hiding away to claw open his own chest. He ripped out the endlessly growing scales, pinned his own hands down with bone nails‚Äîdesperately resisting his dragon instincts.</span></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‚ÄúYao Yao, don‚Äôt come in‚Ä¶‚Äù</span></i></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‚ÄúI beg you‚Ä¶ whatever you do, don‚Äôt come in‚Ä¶‚Äù</span></i></p> <p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be over soon. Be good. Stay outside‚Ä¶‚Äù</span></i></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Outside, Ning Yao pondered, if</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> we can both ascend, that‚Äôs better than neither of us ascending at all.</span></i></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, she went in.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as she always did, she held him in her arms, kissing his trembling, pale lips with tenderness.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">After many 10 thousand years, Ning Yao was reborn and successfully ascended.</span></p> <p>She forgot Feng Jingzhou, but he remembered her.</p> <p>Tormenting himself, he wanted to turn back time.</p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ning Yao was very happy, but the ceremony of conferring the gods was a little simple.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because the entire world of gods was busy trying to stop a fallen god who wants to activate the forbidden Time-Reversal Array.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/> </span> <span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Theme: My heart is controlled by me, not by heavens.</span></p> <p> </p> </div>]]></description>
