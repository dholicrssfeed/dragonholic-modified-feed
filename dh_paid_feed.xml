      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Shin Jisoo is an ordinary woman in her thirties, but her life is a mess. Work is stressful, people are tiring, and now she even has to stop drinking. Feeling desperate, she goes to a shaman. But the shaman says something strange:</p> <p><i>“You’re in for huge bad luck. Really big trouble.”</i><i></i></p> <p>To stop this bad luck, Jisoo must meet a “big man.” It sounds silly— but then she really meets him. Chae Juwon is handsome and too charming to trust.</p> <p>“I’ll tell you now— I don’t know why you’re here, but I’m not interested. I never sleep with people the old man sets me up with.”<i></i></p> <p>Juwon is bold and sly. He shocks Jisoo the first time they meet. And by accident, she finds out that the “big” rumor about him is true.</p> <p>“So, did you get my number just to try it out?”<i></i></p> <p>Jisoo just wants a quiet life, but Juwon keeps pulling her into trouble. Still, in this mess, she finds new chances and feelings she can’t ignore.</p> <p>“Why are you so kind to me, Mr. Chae?”</p> <p>“I don’t know. I just want to be kind to you, Ms. Shin.”</p> <p>As her biggest problem gets closer, this man keeps showing up. Can Jisoo really grab her “big luck” — or will it run away again?</p> </div>]]></description>

His work is as unusual as his mysterious aura.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Female Lead:</strong> <em>Woo Seula</em> — her life turned upside down after a sudden outbreak on her skin. While desperately looking for a cure, she crosses paths with Kang Taeshin.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>When to Read:</strong> When you want a romantic comedy wrapped up in exorcism and fate.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Story Intro</strong></p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Woo Seula’s whole body suddenly breaks out in a rash, and no doctor can explain. After trying everything she can think of, she finally goes to see a shaman — and finds out what she has is called Mudoo.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Following the shaman’s instructions, she heads to Cheonghae-dong 118-gil 4 — and that’s where she meets a man named Kang Tae-shin.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Seula, I’d like you to help me with my work.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t work at night. I’m a morning person — I need to stick to a routine and be active during the day.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Three days from now. Ten at night. Come to Cheonghae-dong.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">She thought he was just some weirdo — but after meeting him, the Mudoo clears up completely, and her body feels light again.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Except… now she’s seeing things she shouldn’t be seeing — and panic sets in.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Is it really that scary, seeing what’s in front of you?”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“…Can’t you make it so I don’t see them again?”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Just pretend you don’t see, don’t hear, don’t feel anything. Act exactly like you did before your third eye opened.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">A man whose true nature is a mystery — Kang Tae-shin — and Donggil, a talking dog who claims he’s a spirit.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">Living with them, Seula has no choice but to exorcise ghosts — in this strange, chilly story full of secrets.</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Still, if you ever get too scared… come to me.”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“…”</p> <p style="font-weight: 400">“Tonight, I’ll come pick you up.”</p> </div>]]></description>

Work is stressful, people are tiring, and now she even has to stop drinking. Feeling desperate, she goes to a shaman. But the shaman says something strange:</p> <p><i>“You’re in for huge bad luck. Really big trouble.”</i><i></i></p> <p>To stop this bad luck, Jisoo must meet a “big man.” It sounds silly— but then she really meets him. Chae Juwon is handsome and too charming to trust.</p> <p>“I’ll tell you now— I don’t know why you’re here, but I’m not interested. I never sleep with people the old man sets me up with.”<i></i></p> <p>Juwon is bold and sly. He shocks Jisoo the first time they meet. And by accident, she finds out that the “big” rumor about him is true.</p> <p>“So, did you get my number just to try it out?”<i></i></p> <p>Jisoo just wants a quiet life, but Juwon keeps pulling her into trouble. Still, in this mess, she finds new chances and feelings she can’t ignore.</p> <p>“Why are you so kind to me, Mr. Chae?”</p> <p>“I don’t know. I just want to be kind to you, Ms. Shin.”</p> <p>As her biggest problem gets closer, this man keeps showing up. Can Jisoo really grab her “big luck” — or will it run away again?</p> </div>]]></description>
