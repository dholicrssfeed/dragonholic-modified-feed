      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>What made Jiang Chuxie collapse even more than transmigrating into a <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span>-type novel was that she became the scumbag Alpha dad of the book’s female lead… or rather, mom?</p> <p>The scumbag Alpha mom relied on the female lead’s mother, Gu Lingjun, to rise to wealth and prominence. She teamed up with her mistress to kill the original wife and seize the family fortune that should have belonged to the female lead, setting the stage for the female lead’s tragic life.</p> <p>As for the ending, this scumbag Alpha naturally didn’t fare well either. She was ultimately ruined by her daughter’s six Alphas, left with a shattered family and no place to be buried.</p> <p>Jiang Chuxie had no desire to follow in the original body’s footsteps. She didn’t want to be a scumbag, nor did she want to be killed. She just wanted to live peacefully… Wait, why does the person sleeping beside her look so much like… Gu Lingjun?</p> <p>Jiang Chuxie couldn’t escape the fate of an ABO novel. Forced to marry due to pregnancy and reluctantly accepting her fate, the gentle Omega, who had always been submissive, suddenly changed drastically. She broke up, threw money at her, and ran off pregnant, turning the tables and making Jiang Chuxie the one who got played.</p> <p>Jiang Chuxie: Wait, isn’t something off with this plot?</p> <p>Gu Lingjun: If it’s off, that’s just right.</p> <p>Content tags: Childbirth, Soul Swap, Rekindled Romance, Feel-Good, ABO, Lighthearted</p> </div>]]></description>
