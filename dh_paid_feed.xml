      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>“Every day, a recurring hellish dream. Junseong is stuck in a world that feels like an endless loop, much like a roguelike game. It’s a cursed world where he struggles every day. Two months have passed since he set foot in the zombie apocalypse world in his dreams. “Ha….” As soon as he woke up, his gaze was instinctively drawn to the internet broadcast that he habitually left on. -A major riot is occurring in some regions due to the current situation… Then, beep! A loud sound announcing a disaster alert echoed in Junseong’s head. Unconsciously picking up his phone along with the alarm sound, Junseong couldn’t hide his confused expression.<br/> [10:44 AM] It was the exact time he had always woken up in his dream. Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. “I’ve been wanting to ask you something.”<br/> “What?” As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo’s gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. “Why do you look at me like that?” Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. “How am I… looking at you?”<br/> “….” Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the ‘fake smile’ he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his ‘clothes’ but emanated from him.“</p> </div>]]></description>

The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. “Why do you look at me like that?” Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. “How am I… looking at you?”<br/> “….” Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the ‘fake smile’ he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his ‘clothes’ but emanated from him.“</p> </div>]]></description>

However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. “I’ve been wanting to ask you something.”<br/> “What?” As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo’s gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. “Why do you look at me like that?” Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. “How am I… looking at you?”<br/> “….” Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the ‘fake smile’ he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of <span class="censored" data-replacement="oybbq">bl00d</span> from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his ‘clothes’ but emanated from him.“</p> </div>]]></description>
