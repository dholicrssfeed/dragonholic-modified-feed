      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Gu Yu Qi, a daughter born to a marquis household. She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky. It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.</p> <p>But what happened to her in the end?</p> <p>For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.</p> <p>If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.</p> <p>Who knew he’d be reborn again…</p> <p>When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky. Just what are you playing at!?</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>When Yu Jing was 19 years old, she still hadn’t differentiated, but it didn’t affect her image as a beautiful and strong Alpha in the eyes of her fans.</p> <p>Three years after her debut, she won over a huge group of loyal fans while somehow gaining an enemy—actress Ming Zhu, known as the queen of ratings.</p> <p>Ming Zhu was an Alpha; sheclashed with Yu Jing at an event, and Yu Jing thought they’d never cross paths again. But, by some twist of fate, they were invited to the same reality show.</p> <p>Before filming even started, their fans were already tearing each other apart on Weibo.</p> <p>Yu Jing couldn’t resist checking the comments and got angrier the more she read.</p> <p>She could accept being called a has-been, and she could tolerate accusations of riding Ming Zhu’s fame. But someone dared question her gender, saying she’d definitely differentiate as an Omega???</p> <p>Yu Jing suppressed the urge to jump into the fray, secretly swearing: Once I differentiate into a top-tier Alpha, I’ll crush all you haters and your idol into the ground!</p> <p>Then she differentiated into a delicate Omega.</p> <p>And got pinned against the wall by Ming Zhu.</p> <p>In an intimate room—</p> <p>Ming Zhu’s fingers brushed over the fragile skin hiding her gland, looking down at the person in her arms, her tone soft: “Are you okay?”</p> <p>Yu Jing’s hands weakly clung to her neck, her cheeks flushed, her voice soft and pleading:</p> <p>“Mark me already, please.”</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Warnings:</strong><br/> 1. Lots of original world-building, Alphas don’t have male anatomy.<br/> 2. Melodramatic plot, slow-burn romance, proceed with caution if it’s not your thing.</p> <p>Main Characters: Yu Jing, Ming Zhu | Supporting Characters: |</p> <p> </p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.</p> <p>After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor’s chest: “Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?”<br/> The new emperor kissed her: “You will be fine, just love me.”<br/> The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: “Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left.”</p> <p>When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess’s obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official’s wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.</p> <p>Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.<br/> ——</p> <p>The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.</p> <p>Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.</p> <p>For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, “The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated,” before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. <span class="censored" data-replacement="Oybbq">Bl00d</span> poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.</p> <p>Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: “Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?”</p> <p>“… She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore.”</p> <p>Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: “She said she won’t fight, so the fight is over?”</p> <hr/> <p>If you’re enjoying the story, please consider:</p> <ol> <li>Supporting the author</li> <li>Rating or leaving a review on <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/after-rebirth-i-married-my-archenemy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NovelUpdates</a>!</li> </ol> <p>If you spot any mistakes in my translation, feel free to DM me on Discord (KatTL) or report it at <a href="https://discord.gg/FWwrYycV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragonholic Discord server</a>.</p> <p><strong>Release schedule:</strong> 1 chapter will be unlocked every 3 days. 1-2 advance chapters will be updated only on weekdays.</p> <hr/> <p>If you enjoy my translations and want to sprinkle a little joy in my cup, you can treat me to a coffee on Ko-fi or support me at Patreon!

      <title>Giving Interstellar Players a Horror Ghost Game Shock</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!</p> <p>What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!</p> <p>With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!</p> <p>She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”</p> <p>She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”</p> <p>She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”</p> <p>Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”</p> <p>Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”</p> <p> </p> <hr/> <p>If you’re enjoying the story, please consider:</p> <ol> <li>Supporting the author</li> <li>Rating or leaving a review on <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/giving-interstellar-players-a-horror-ghost-game-shock/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NovelUpdates</a>!</li> </ol> <p>If you spot any mistakes in my translation, feel free to DM me on Discord (KatTL) or report it at <a href="https://discord.gg/FWwrYycV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragonholic Discord server</a>.</p> <p> </p> <hr/> <p>If you enjoy my translations and want to sprinkle a little joy in my cup, you can treat me to a coffee on Ko-fi or support me at Patreon!
