      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Summary 1:</p> <p>“Even if it’s a one-for-one trade, I will take over his company.”</p> <p>These were the last words Luan Yenan said before transmigrating into a book.</p> <p>As the sole head of a Fortune 500 investment company, she never expected her end to be dying from overwork after three sleepless days and nights, only to transmigrate into a novel.</p> <p>The character she transmigrated into was a crazy, abusive Alpha who tormented the female lead before having her glands removed by the seemingly innocent but secretly cunning female lead.</p> <p>Crazy? Perfect, I’m crazy too.</p> <p>Abusive Alpha? Sorry, I’m single and not interested.</p> <p>As for the female lead, are you talking about the little girl I’ve pinned down, teary-eyed and begging for mercy?</p> <p>Seemingly innocent but secretly cunning? Interesting.</p> <p>Let me personally train her. I want to see how she plans to cut out my glands.</p> <p>Summary 2:</p> <p>Zuo Baixuan, who had just differentiated into an Omega, was sold by her adoptive parents to a crazy, abusive Alpha. She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, “I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early.”</p> <p>After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.</p> <p>One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: “I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce.”</p> <p>Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: “I’ve already graduated.”</p> <p>“So?”</p> <p>“I want to have a child. With you.”</p> <p>Let’s see who’s really the crazy one.</p> </div>]]></description>
