      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>At the princess’s banquet, in a secluded hall, Helan Ci pressed her palm against the wall, encountering the equally disheveled newly crowned top scholar Lu Wuyou. One was as delicate as a willow, the other had a flushed face.</p> <p>Their eyes met, and in each other’s gaze, they saw a glimmer of despair.<br/> “I’ll go first…”<br/> “I’ll head that way…”</p> <p>However, what was even more despairing was the sound of the princess’s maid and the second prince’s attendant searching for them not far away.<br/> Helan Ci bit her lip: “What don’t you just go to the princess?”<br/> Lu Wuyou endured: “I think the second prince is not bad either.”<br/> Helan Ci: “If we keep talking, we’ll only end up hurting each other!”<br/> Lu Wuyou closed his eyes: “Then let it be a mutual destruction.”<br/> Helan Ci: “…?”</p> <p>A night later, their innocence was lost, and they were forced into marriage. Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband’s demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.<br/> Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”<br/> Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to. Who told me to marry you— I’m going to be a powerful minister. I can’t fall here.”<br/> Helan Ci, “Then do your best! I’m counting on you!”<br/> Lu Wuyou, “…?”</p> <p>Years later, Lu Wuyou became the Prime Minister, holding the highest position among officials, wielding immense power across the land, and reflecting on the past.</p> <p>A student asked him how he had come this far.</p> <p>Prime Minister Lu thought to himself that as long as one marries a wife of extraordinary beauty, often coveted by others, it would always inspire one to strive to make progress.</p> <p>=====</p> <p>Two chapters will be free every week (Sat &amp; Sunday).</p> <p>If you enjoy this story consider rate and review this at NovelUpdates, also support me at ko-fi</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>At the princess’s banquet, in a secluded hall, Helan Ci pressed her palm against the wall, encountering the equally disheveled newly crowned top scholar Lu Wuyou. One was as delicate as a willow, the other had a flushed face.</p> <p>Their eyes met, and in each other’s gaze, they saw a glimmer of despair.<br/> “I’ll go first…”<br/> “I’ll head that way…”</p> <p>However, what was even more despairing was the sound of the princess’s maid and the second prince’s attendant searching for them not far away.<br/> Helan Ci bit her lip: “What don’t you just go to the princess?”<br/> Lu Wuyou endured: “I think the second prince is not bad either.”<br/> Helan Ci: “If we keep talking, we’ll only end up hurting each other!”<br/> Lu Wuyou closed his eyes: “Then let it be a mutual destruction.”<br/> Helan Ci: “…?”</p> <p>A night later, their innocence was lost, and they were forced into marriage. Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband’s demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.<br/> Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”<br/> Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to. Who told me to marry you— I’m going to be a powerful minister. I can’t fall here.”<br/> Helan Ci, “Then do your best!

One was as delicate as a willow, the other had a flushed face.</p> <p>Their eyes met, and in each other’s gaze, they saw a glimmer of despair.<br/> “I’ll go first…”<br/> “I’ll head that way…”</p> <p>However, what was even more despairing was the sound of the princess’s maid and the second prince’s attendant searching for them not far away.<br/> Helan Ci bit her lip: “What don’t you just go to the princess?”<br/> Lu Wuyou endured: “I think the second prince is not bad either.”<br/> Helan Ci: “If we keep talking, we’ll only end up hurting each other!”<br/> Lu Wuyou closed his eyes: “Then let it be a mutual destruction.”<br/> Helan Ci: “…?”</p> <p>A night later, their innocence was lost, and they were forced into marriage. Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband’s demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.<br/> Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”<br/> Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to. Who told me to marry you— I’m going to be a powerful minister. I can’t fall here.”<br/> Helan Ci, “Then do your best! I’m counting on you!”<br/> Lu Wuyou, “…?”</p> <p>Years later, Lu Wuyou became the Prime Minister, holding the highest position among officials, wielding immense power across the land, and reflecting on the past.</p> <p>A student asked him how he had come this far.</p> <p>Prime Minister Lu thought to himself that as long as one marries a wife of extraordinary beauty, often coveted by others, it would always inspire one to strive to make progress.</p> <p>=====</p> <p>Two chapters will be free every week (Sat &amp; Sunday).</p> <p>If you enjoy this story consider rate and review this at NovelUpdates, also support me at ko-fi</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.</p> <p>Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.</p> <p>Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.</p> <p>The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…</p> <p>The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.</p> <p>That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.</p> <hr/> <p>Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.</p> <p>At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.</p> <p>He could smile, she realised, but not for her.</p> <p>From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.</p> <p>Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.</p> <hr/> <p>After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.</p> <p>But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.</p> <p>On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”</p> <p>Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”</p> <p>Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.</p> <p>For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.</p> </div>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.</p> <p>After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor’s chest: “Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?”<br/> The new emperor kissed her: “You will be fine, just love me.”<br/> The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: “Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left.”</p> <p>When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess’s obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official’s wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.</p> <p>Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.<br/> ——</p> <p>The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.</p> <p>Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.</p> <p>For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, “The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated,” before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. <span class="censored" data-replacement="Oybbq">Bl00d</span> poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.</p> <p>Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: “Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?”</p> <p>“… She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore.”</p> <p>Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: “She said she won’t fight, so the fight is over?”</p> <hr/> <p>If you’re enjoying the story, please consider:</p> <ol> <li>Supporting the author</li> <li>Rating or leaving a review on <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/after-rebirth-i-married-my-archenemy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NovelUpdates</a>!</li> </ol> <p>If you spot any mistakes in my translation, feel free to DM me on Discord (KatTL) or report it at <a href="https://discord.gg/FWwrYycV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragonholic Discord server</a>.</p> <p><strong>Release schedule:</strong> 1 chapter will be unlocked every 3 days. 1-2 advance chapters will be updated only on weekdays.</p> <hr/> <p>If you enjoy my translations and want to sprinkle a little joy in my cup, you can treat me to a coffee on Ko-fi or support me at Patreon!
