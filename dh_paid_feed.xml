      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.</p> <p>After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor‚Äôs chest: ‚ÄúQung Qing is dead, what should I do?‚Äù<br/> The new emperor kissed her: ‚ÄúYou will be fine, just love me.‚Äù<br/> The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: ‚ÄúQung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left.‚Äù</p> <p>When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess‚Äôs obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official‚Äôs wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.</p> <p>Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.<br/> ‚Äî‚Äî</p> <p>The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.</p> <p>Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.</p> <p>For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, ‚ÄúThe king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated,‚Äù before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. <span class="censored" data-replacement="Oybbq">Bl00d</span> poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.</p> <p>Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: ‚ÄúWhere is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?‚Äù</p> <p>‚Äú‚Ä¶ She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore.‚Äù</p> <p>Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: ‚ÄúShe said she won‚Äôt fight, so the fight is over?‚Äù</p> <hr/> <p>If you‚Äôre enjoying the story, please consider:</p> <ol> <li>Supporting the author</li> <li>Rating or leaving a review on <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/after-rebirth-i-married-my-archenemy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NovelUpdates</a>!</li> </ol> <p>If you spot any mistakes in my translation, feel free to DM me on Discord (KatTL) or report it at <a href="https://discord.gg/FWwrYycV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragonholic Discord server</a>.</p> <p><strong>Release schedule:</strong> 1 chapter will be unlocked every 3 days. 1-2 advance chapters will be updated only on weekdays.</p> <hr/> <p>If you enjoy my translations and want to sprinkle a little joy in my cup, you can treat me to a coffee on Ko-fi or support me at Patreon!

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="summary__content show-more"> <p>Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.</p> <p>After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor‚Äôs chest: ‚ÄúQung Qing is dead, what should I do?‚Äù<br/> The new emperor kissed her: ‚ÄúYou will be fine, just love me.‚Äù<br/> The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: ‚ÄúQung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left.‚Äù</p> <p>When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess‚Äôs obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official‚Äôs wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.</p> <p>Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.<br/> ‚Äî‚Äî</p> <p>The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.</p> <p>Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.</p> <p>For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, ‚ÄúThe king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated,‚Äù before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. <span class="censored" data-replacement="Oybbq">Bl00d</span> poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.</p> <p>When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.</p> <p>Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: ‚ÄúWhere is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?‚Äù</p> <p>‚Äú‚Ä¶ She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore.‚Äù</p> <p>Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: ‚ÄúShe said she won‚Äôt fight, so the fight is over?‚Äù</p> <hr/> <p>If you‚Äôre enjoying the story, please consider:</p> <ol> <li>Supporting the author</li> <li>Rating or leaving a review on <a href="https://www.novelupdates.com/series/after-rebirth-i-married-my-archenemy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NovelUpdates</a>!</li> </ol> <p>If you spot any mistakes in my translation, feel free to DM me on Discord (KatTL) or report it at <a href="https://discord.gg/FWwrYycV" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dragonholic Discord server</a>.</p> <p><strong>Release schedule:</strong> 1 chapter will be unlocked every 3 days. 1-2 advance chapters will be updated only on weekdays.</p> <hr/> <p>If you enjoy my translations and want to sprinkle a little joy in my cup, you can treat me to a coffee on Ko-fi or support me at Patreon!

She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.</p> <p>But what happened to her in the end?</p> <p>For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn‚Äôt too late to change her fate.</p> <p>If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman‚Äôs ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.</p> <p>Who knew he‚Äôd be reborn again‚Ä¶</p> <p>When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky.
