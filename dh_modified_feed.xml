      <description><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Male Lead:</strong> <em>Kang Tae-shin</em> — owner of 4, Cheonghae-dong 118-gil. His work is as unusual as his mysterious aura.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Female Lead:</strong> <em>Woo Seula</em> — her life turned upside down after a sudden outbreak on her skin. While desperately looking for a cure, she crosses paths with Kang Taeshin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When to Read:</strong> When you want a romantic comedy wrapped up in exorcism and fate.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Story Intro</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Woo Seula’s whole body suddenly breaks out in a rash, and no doctor can explain. After trying everything she can think of, she finally goes to see a shaman — and finds out what she has is called Mudoo.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Following the shaman’s instructions, she heads to Cheonghae-dong 118-gil 4 — and that’s where she meets a man named Kang Tae-shin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Seula, I’d like you to help me with my work.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t work at night. I’m a morning person — I need to stick to a routine and be active during the day.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Three days from now. Ten at night. Come to Cheonghae-dong.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">She thought he was just some weirdo — but after meeting him, the Mudoo clears up completely, and her body feels light again.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Except… now she’s seeing things she shouldn’t be seeing — and panic sets in.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it really that scary, seeing what’s in front of you?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“…Can’t you make it so I don’t see them again?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Just pretend you don’t see, don’t hear, don’t feel anything. Act exactly like you did before your third eye opened.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A man whose true nature is a mystery — Kang Tae-shin — and Donggil, a talking dog who claims he’s a spirit.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Living with them, Seula has no choice but to exorcise ghosts — in this strange, chilly story full of secrets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Still, if you ever get too scared… come to me.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Tonight, I’ll come pick you up.”</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Li Mohan was of Han blood, yet everyone in the family despised her. All she wanted was to keep her head down, endure quietly, and make it to the day she could stand on her own.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That was until the night her younger uncle, Han Yezhen, forced her down on the bed, drove his cock into her virgin body, and shattered everything. From then on, everything spiraled beyond her control.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">She tried to escape Han Yezhen’s advances, all while enduring her cousin’s bullying at school.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In despair, she came up with what she thought was the perfect solution.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">She schemed and stole away her cousin’s boyfriend, Qin Yuchen.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uncle… I have a boyfriend now.”</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Han Yezhen pressed a kiss against the thick waves of her hair. “Do you? Then tell me—how does your boyfriend fuck you?”</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Real uncle. Forced love. A desire laid in wait.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Han Yezhen was no good man—jealousy twisted him into madness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Li Mohan looked soft and delicate, but inside she was every bit as unhinged.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Qin Yuchen, the poor bastard, lost his mind too in the end.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A plot-driven smut novel: the process is 1v2, but the ending 1v1.</span>

These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand. Holding the cannon fodder's script, Sheng Nuan is terrified...
Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

      <title>After Transmigrating, I and the Female Lead Both Found It 'Really Fragrant' (GL)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Shen Qiqi, a prolific author of female-led novels, was known for her love of torturing the female leads in her stories. She would make the female leads suffer, become isolated, and ultimately turn to the dark side before making a triumphant return.
Never in her wildest dreams did she imagine she would be transported into one of her own novels, turning into a mediocre and vicious cannon fodder—a junior sister who delighted in bullying the female lead and was eventually hung on the city wall as punishment.
To survive, she decided to become a carefree and laid-back player, knowing and daring nothing. However, upon seeing the female lead for the first time, she instantly fell head over heels.
To shower the female lead with love and warmth, Shen Qiqi went out of her way to protect her:
* When the female lead was bullied by other vicious cannon fodder, she was the first to help her fight back.
* When the female lead was wronged, she felt heartbroken.
* When the female lead was pursued by a scumbag, she... broke them up!
Meanwhile, Liu Shuang had been reborn with a cold heart, viewing everyone around her as insignificant ants.
Fortunately, she still possessed the magic from her previous life. In this new life, everything remained unchanged except for her once arrogant and overbearing junior sister, who now revolved around her, showering her with flattery and affection.
Using her mind-reading ability, she overheard the junior sister's thoughts:
"OMG, the female lead is so beautiful! I can do this!"
"My senior sister is kind, gentle, and understanding. No one can hurt her!"
"Senior sister, don't be so saintly. You'll be bullied by bad people!"
The Demon Lord Liu Shuang: ??? I'd rather jump off a building than believe Shen Qiqi again! ... My junior sister is so cute, I'm so into her.
A carefree, optimistic, appearance-obsessed salted fish vs. a cold-on-the-outside-but-warm-on-the-inside, beautiful and powerful Demon Lord
1v1 HE, light-hearted and sweet]]></description>

      <title>The Male Lead's Harem Belongs to Me (GL)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Jiang Han died from staying up too late reading a novel, and after her death, she found herself transported into the ancient melodramatic romance novel she had been reading.
The male lead is a cold and domineering prince, and the female lead is the prince's long-cherished "white moonlight". Unfortunately, the white moonlight has a lowly status, and the prince's mother disapproves. The male lead goes to great lengths, enduring countless melodramatic events, heart-wrenching and physically exhausting, ultimately winning the heart of his beloved and achieving a happy ending. And Jiang Han is one of the cannon fodder female characters who, out of jealousy, targeted the male lead's white moonlight.
Jiang Han, who traveled through time, said: "No way, I just want to be a salted fish and play mahjong every day."
So when the male lead said: "I want to marry my white moonlight."
Jiang Han: Marry! You must marry! The gifts are all ready.
The male lead said: "She is timid and frail. As the princess, you should take good care of her."
Jiang Han: Take care! Must take care of !Tomorrow, I'll have her live next to me!
The male lead said: "She's too considerate. She won't speak up about her needs, so you should be more accommodating to her."
Jiang Han: Move! Must yield! Tomorrow, I will divorce you and give the title of princess to her!
••••
The next day, Jiang Han indeed handed him a divorce letter. The male lead, feeling complicated, signed it, but Jiang Han happily prepared to leave. Just as she reached the gate of the mansion, a group of concubines led by White Moonlight blocked her way.
White Moonlight: Sister Jiang, don't go. Would you stay?
A group of concubines: Yeah, yeah, please don't leave.
Jiang Han showed a troubled expression, and the male lead's heart was filled with joy. Just as he was about to say a few words of persuasion, he saw Jiang Han decisively shake her head.
The male lead thought it was a pity. Before he could catch his breath, he saw the person he held dear, his "white moonlight," take out a divorce agreement and coldly say to him, "Sign it. I want to leave with Sister Jiang."
The male lead stared wide-eyed in disbelief, a mouthful of old blood choked in his chest. However, the next moment, his group of concubines gritted their teeth and said to White Moonlight: "Weiwei, you are being too ungrateful. Why did you prepare the divorce papers all by yourself without telling us?"
#My harem seems to have turned into my princess's, what should I do#
#Is it too late to regret now#
••••
One-on-one [highlight this], before the divorce, they were just pure revolutionary comrades and good friends. After the divorce, there will be romantic developments.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao died tragically.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The man she had saved and cared for for many years despised her and shattered her spirit veins with his own hands and dissolved her body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. I have waited for this day.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan's ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And Ning Yao's lifelong wish is to ascend.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft—those fools don’t know his worth. He’s from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it works, great. If not… well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions. When that happens, their instincts will turn against their beloved, giving rise to an uncontrollable urge to kill.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slay one’s beloved, attain enlightenment, ascend immediately, and forget the past.</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfect outcome for both.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao knew that Feng Jingzhuo had already begun to grow his heart’s scales.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, he endured the agonizing pain, hiding away to claw open his own chest. He ripped out the endlessly growing scales, pinned his own hands down with bone nails—desperately resisting his dragon instincts.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, don’t come in…”</span></i>

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Qing wakes up to find herself transported into an ancient famine novel, becoming a shameless rogue. During a famine, the original host scams food and drink in the city, committing all sorts of evil deeds. With an innocent and harmless face, she tricks the distressed Jiang Jinhuang into marrying her. After the marriage, the original host’s true nature is revealed. When Jiang Jinhuang refuses to consummate the marriage, the host relentlessly pressures and torments her, even nearly strangling Jiang Jinhuang’s younger sister to death. After enduring countless hardships, Jiang Jinhuang finally returns to the capital, where her family and childhood friend deal with the original host, whose final destination is a mass grave outside the city.
Ye Qing, having received the entire plot, plans to stay far away from Jiang Jinhuang and live well in this ancient world. But just as she prepares to leave, her personal system activates, unlocking the spatial ability from her previous life. Unlike before, her space now includes land and a spiritual spring. The system tells her that by earning Jiang Jinhuang’s favor, she can gain rewards to ensure she won’t starve during the famine.
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 potato seeds;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with a 2-pound carp;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 eggs…
Through her efforts, Ye Qing helps Jiang Jinhuang and her sister thrive during the famine. When she successfully escorts Jiang Jinhuang back to the capital and prepares to leave alone, Jiang Jinhuang’s eyes redden with tears.
Jiang Jinhuang, the daughter of the Minister of Rites, is separated from her family during a visit to Linzhou when they are scattered by rioters. After many struggles, she reaches Linzhou but fails to find her relatives. Lost and desperate, she believes Ye Qing’s words and temporarily marries her. However, after the marriage, Ye Qing becomes a different person, constantly abusing her. Then, one day, Ye Qing suddenly changes for the better, protecting Jiang Jinhuang and her sister, ensuring they never go hungry. Later, Ye Qing even escorts them back to the capital. When Ye Qing tries to leave, Jiang Jinhuang blocks the door, her fox-like eyes staring at Ye Qing with an unreadable expression, saying, “Where do you think you’re going, abandoning me?”

      <title>Failed to Pretend to Be an Alpha and Got Marked by the Enemy (ABO, GL)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[When Yu Jing was 19 years old, she still hadn’t differentiated, but it didn’t affect her image as a beautiful and strong Alpha in the eyes of her fans.
Three years after her debut, she won over a huge group of loyal fans while somehow gaining an enemy—actress Ming Zhu, known as the queen of ratings.
Ming Zhu was an Alpha; sheclashed with Yu Jing at an event, and Yu Jing thought they’d never cross paths again. But, by some twist of fate, they were invited to the same reality show.
Before filming even started, their fans were already tearing each other apart on Weibo.
Yu Jing couldn’t resist checking the comments and got angrier the more she read.
She could accept being called a has-been, and she could tolerate accusations of riding Ming Zhu’s fame. But someone dared question her gender, saying she’d definitely differentiate as an Omega???
Yu Jing suppressed the urge to jump into the fray, secretly swearing: Once I differentiate into a top-tier Alpha, I’ll crush all you haters and your idol into the ground!
Then she differentiated into a delicate Omega.
And got pinned against the wall by Ming Zhu.
In an intimate room—
Ming Zhu’s fingers brushed over the fragile skin hiding her gland, looking down at the person in her arms, her tone soft: “Are you okay?”
Yu Jing’s hands weakly clung to her neck, her cheeks flushed, her voice soft and pleading:
“Mark me already, please.”
<hr />
<strong>Warnings:</strong>
1. Lots of original world-building, Alphas don’t have male anatomy.
2. Melodramatic plot, slow-burn romance, proceed with caution if it’s not your thing.
Main Characters: Yu Jing, Ming Zhu | Supporting Characters: |

      <title>Dressed as the Scumbag Alpha Mom of the Tragic Female Lead (ABO, GL)</title>
      <volume/>

      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/dressed-as-the-scumbag-alpha-mom-of-the-tragic-female-lead/chapter-52/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[What made Jiang Chuxie collapse even more than transmigrating into a blood-type novel was that she became the scumbag Alpha dad of the book’s female lead… or rather, mom?
The scumbag Alpha mom relied on the female lead’s mother, Gu Lingjun, to rise to wealth and prominence. She teamed up with her mistress to kill the original wife and seize the family fortune that should have belonged to the female lead, setting the stage for the female lead’s tragic life.
As for the ending, this scumbag Alpha naturally didn’t fare well either. She was ultimately ruined by her daughter’s six Alphas, left with a shattered family and no place to be buried.
Jiang Chuxie had no desire to follow in the original body’s footsteps. She didn’t want to be a scumbag, nor did she want to be killed. She just wanted to live peacefully… Wait, why does the person sleeping beside her look so much like… Gu Lingjun?
Jiang Chuxie couldn’t escape the fate of an ABO novel. Forced to marry due to pregnancy and reluctantly accepting her fate, the gentle Omega, who had always been submissive, suddenly changed drastically. She broke up, threw money at her, and ran off pregnant, turning the tables and making Jiang Chuxie the one who got played.
Jiang Chuxie: Wait, isn’t something off with this plot?
Gu Lingjun: If it’s off, that’s just right.

      <description><![CDATA[Yu Heyi received a wedding invitation from the Omega she had secretly loved for years, she was lying in a hospital bed.
She got into a car accident during a race and had to retire.
Under the double blow, Yu Heyi accepted her mom’s suggestion.
Going on a blind date.
Her mom praised the other person like crazy, saying they were a perfect Omega, beautiful and soft and gentle.
Then…
She found out the blind date was her most hated person, no one else came close!
Her love rival—Chi Ruixi.
She still hadn’t figured out how her beta love rival turned into an Omega.
And on the day of the blind date, she marked her.
It was Chi Ruixi, crying and begging her to mark her…
Afterward, Yu Heyi said three things.
“I’ll take responsibility, I’ll fulfill an Alpha’s duties.”
“I’ll treat you well, I’ll be considerate.”
“But don’t expect love.”
Chi Ruixi heard this, gave a slight smile, and said, “No need.”
Jobless Yu Heyi was arranged by her mom to work as a chef in the cafeteria of XX Middle School.
She found out the gentle and delicate literature teacher was—Chi Ruixi?
But Chi Ruixi’s cold words made her feel weird, a bit uncomfortable.
Yu Heyi thought it was pheromones that drew her to Chi Ruixi, otherwise why would she find
Chi Ruixi, the bridesmaid at the wedding, way more charming than the bride she’d loved for years.
Then, in a daze, she permanently marked Chi Ruixi.
Chi Ruixi kept waiting for that dumb Alpha to admit she loved her, but her dumb Alpha was truly dumb.

      <description><![CDATA[Zhou Yining died suddenly after 17 hours of intense work. When she woke up, she found herself transported into a romance novel, becoming the self-conscious and sensitive female lead.
The original character was a student at Nanchuan City No. 1 High School with average grades but secretly in love with the male lead, Zhang Ye. This caused the female supporting characters in the book to viciously slander her and even bully her at school. Among them, the one who hated the original character the most was the wealthy heiress Jiang Xianzhi.
After enduring persecution from her family, a series of school bullying incidents, and a physically and emotionally abusive relationship with the male lead, the original character finally achieved a happy ending with him.
Thinking about the original plot, Zhou Yining almost laughed in anger. That shitty male lead?
She didn’t care for him at all. It was her senior year, and clearly, the teachers hadn’t assigned enough homework if there was still time for this useless romantic nonsense.
Zhou Yining tore the original plot apart. She studied hard, aiming to top every subject. She rejected her family’s moral manipulation, gathered evidence to send those who bullied the original character to justice, and kicked the male lead, who loved to act cool for no reason, to the curb.
As she fought her way forward, she realized that the rich girl who used to hate her was actually kind of cute. When she got close, the rich girl would even blush?
Jiang Xianzhi realized she didn’t hate Zhou Yining anymore. Ever since Zhou Yining came back from being sick, she’d been acting strange. She wasn’t afraid of Jiang Xianzhi anymore and sometimes said weird things that made Jiang Xianzhi’s face turn red.
So Jiang Xianzhi’s daily life became:
September 2: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 3: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 4: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red…
September 13: After more than ten days of defeat, the rich girl decided to stand up for herself!
But on September 14, she was still teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red!

She was a straight woman, crossed into a porn game she played years ago.
She wondered why the hell it was a modified version.
Did it want to drive her mad?
——
Wei Qing calmed her mood and often looked at the obedient cute girl with loving eyes.
She nodded satisfactorily—she was a good child.
Wei Qing drank the water the girl handed her without caution.
She went to bed and felt especially sleepy today.
She grew somewhat drowsy...
——

The girl was completely naked; she straddled her waist.

After all, as a vicious female supporting character, Li Suimei’s role as a stepping stone for the male and female leads was almost over.
Why would Qin Qing come to help her?
Li Suimei chuckled bitterly. She had heard rumors about Qin Qing being very protective of her loved ones, but she didn't know who had spread those rumors.
——At the engagement ceremony, Qin Qing, who was originally not supposed to attend, suddenly appeared. Wearing a snow-white wedding dress, she stood in the position that should have belonged to the male protagonist and said expressionlessly,
"Now, you are my wife."
Li Suimei: "..."
Didn't this person seem indifferent towards her just yesterday?

Small Theater:
Qin Qing pinched Li Suimei's wrist, her gaze fierce, "Back then, I always thought, you invited me to dinner and movies, stayed up late with me to go through documents, hugged my arm and cried, calling me 'sister.' Whenever I got angry, you would get nervous, and you even walked in and out of my room in your pajamas. If that wasn't love, what was it?"

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon waking, Shen Chiying discovered she was the vicious supporting villainess in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">His Majesty Regrets Too Late</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“He gave the empress’s seat that should have been hers to her concubine-born younger sister.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, on a night of torrential rain, the emperor stood alone outside a mountain temple, waiting in the cold for her forgiveness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after seizing the realm, Huan Jin’s heart from beginning to end held only the little girl who once helped him escape with his life.”</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And Shen Chiying just happens to be the heroine’s malicious concubine-born sister…</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the book she’s willful and overbearing, big tits and no brains; to climb onto the newly enthroned male lead, she claims the heroine’s life-saving debt as her own.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One lie demands a hundred more, and Shen Chiying starts courting death—again and again framing her legitimate elder sister, the heroine.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end she reaps what she sowed: deposed from the empress’s seat, thrown into a dungeon, tortured daily by every cruel device, unable to live, unable to die.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing the plot ahead of time, Shen Chiying works all the harder when she serves in bed—eyes wet and sultry, obediently arching her perky ass to tend the dragon cock.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Majesty, there’s something this concubine wishes to confess…”</span>

      <description><![CDATA[In the book, she is a useless person from a poor family. Because she is easy to control, Lu Zijin chooses her to be the redundant Alpha of the Lu family.
Originally, she could have just enjoyed the easy life provided, but she gradually became greedy. She not only covets the Lu family’s wealth but also wants to make the female lead, Lu Zijin, submit to her. She tries to harm Lu Zijin several times, but each attempt is exposed. In the end, Lu Zijin and her childhood friend break both of Wei Lan’s legs and throw her out of the Lu family.
A few days later, she dies.
Wei Lan frowns as she looks at the original book’s content: Is the easy life not good enough, or is jade not worth carving? Why would you go and provoke the female lead for no reason?
Learning her lesson, Wei Lan strictly follows the rules Lu Zijin sets for her, never crossing the line or actively seeking Lu Zijin’s attention. She rarely goes out, always holding a few unremarkable stones that she carves.
At first, Lu Zijin finds this redundant Alpha well-behaved. She only allows Wei Lan to share her bed during the heat period and sends her away afterward. Wei Lan never complains.
But gradually, Lu Zijin feels differently about this redundant Alpha. Even after the heat period, she enjoys being around Wei Lan. However, Wei Lan always declines because of the few rough stones she carries, making Lu Zijin dislike those stones.
Over the past year, the most popular jade carver in the Great Zhou Dynasty is Qing Lan. This carver is extremely mysterious, rarely appearing in public. Even when she does, she wears a mask and a wide black hooded cloak, hiding her face.
Her carvings are highly sought after and fetch high prices.
One evening, the so-called redundant Alpha who lives off others returns. Wei Lan holds a stack of silver notes, her eyes sparkling as she looks at Lu Zijin: “Wife, I sold my carved ornaments for a good price again.”
Lu Zijin looks at Wei Lan with gentle eyes: “Good job, very obedient. There’ll be a reward later.”

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Qing wakes up to find herself transported into an ancient famine novel, becoming a shameless rogue. During a famine, the original host scams food and drink in the city, committing all sorts of evil deeds. With an innocent and harmless face, she tricks the distressed Jiang Jinhuang into marrying her. After the marriage, the original host’s true nature is revealed. When Jiang Jinhuang refuses to consummate the marriage, the host relentlessly pressures and torments her, even nearly strangling Jiang Jinhuang’s younger sister to death. After enduring countless hardships, Jiang Jinhuang finally returns to the capital, where her family and childhood friend deal with the original host, whose final destination is a mass grave outside the city.
Ye Qing, having received the entire plot, plans to stay far away from Jiang Jinhuang and live well in this ancient world. But just as she prepares to leave, her personal system activates, unlocking the spatial ability from her previous life. Unlike before, her space now includes land and a spiritual spring. The system tells her that by earning Jiang Jinhuang’s favor, she can gain rewards to ensure she won’t starve during the famine.
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 potato seeds;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with a 2-pound carp;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 eggs…
Through her efforts, Ye Qing helps Jiang Jinhuang and her sister thrive during the famine. When she successfully escorts Jiang Jinhuang back to the capital and prepares to leave alone, Jiang Jinhuang’s eyes redden with tears.
Jiang Jinhuang, the daughter of the Minister of Rites, is separated from her family during a visit to Linzhou when they are scattered by rioters. After many struggles, she reaches Linzhou but fails to find her relatives. Lost and desperate, she believes Ye Qing’s words and temporarily marries her. However, after the marriage, Ye Qing becomes a different person, constantly abusing her. Then, one day, Ye Qing suddenly changes for the better, protecting Jiang Jinhuang and her sister, ensuring they never go hungry. Later, Ye Qing even escorts them back to the capital. When Ye Qing tries to leave, Jiang Jinhuang blocks the door, her fox-like eyes staring at Ye Qing with an unreadable expression, saying, “Where do you think you’re going, abandoning me?”

      <title>The Young Marquis Regrets Too Late</title>
      <volume/>

      <description><![CDATA[Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.
Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.
Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.
Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.
The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…
The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.
That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.
<hr />
Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.
Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.
At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.
He could smile, she realised, but not for her.
From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.
Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.
<hr />
After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.
But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.
On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”
Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”
Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.
For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.]]></description>

      <title>Failed to Pretend to Be an Alpha and Got Marked by the Enemy (ABO, GL)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[When Yu Jing was 19 years old, she still hadn’t differentiated, but it didn’t affect her image as a beautiful and strong Alpha in the eyes of her fans.
Three years after her debut, she won over a huge group of loyal fans while somehow gaining an enemy—actress Ming Zhu, known as the queen of ratings.
Ming Zhu was an Alpha; sheclashed with Yu Jing at an event, and Yu Jing thought they’d never cross paths again. But, by some twist of fate, they were invited to the same reality show.
Before filming even started, their fans were already tearing each other apart on Weibo.
Yu Jing couldn’t resist checking the comments and got angrier the more she read.
She could accept being called a has-been, and she could tolerate accusations of riding Ming Zhu’s fame. But someone dared question her gender, saying she’d definitely differentiate as an Omega???
Yu Jing suppressed the urge to jump into the fray, secretly swearing: Once I differentiate into a top-tier Alpha, I’ll crush all you haters and your idol into the ground!
Then she differentiated into a delicate Omega.
And got pinned against the wall by Ming Zhu.
In an intimate room—
Ming Zhu’s fingers brushed over the fragile skin hiding her gland, looking down at the person in her arms, her tone soft: “Are you okay?”
Yu Jing’s hands weakly clung to her neck, her cheeks flushed, her voice soft and pleading:
“Mark me already, please.”
<hr />
<strong>Warnings:</strong>
1. Lots of original world-building, Alphas don’t have male anatomy.
2. Melodramatic plot, slow-burn romance, proceed with caution if it’s not your thing.
Main Characters: Yu Jing, Ming Zhu | Supporting Characters: |

      <description><![CDATA[What made Jiang Chuxie collapse even more than transmigrating into a blood-type novel was that she became the scumbag Alpha dad of the book’s female lead… or rather, mom?
The scumbag Alpha mom relied on the female lead’s mother, Gu Lingjun, to rise to wealth and prominence. She teamed up with her mistress to kill the original wife and seize the family fortune that should have belonged to the female lead, setting the stage for the female lead’s tragic life.
As for the ending, this scumbag Alpha naturally didn’t fare well either. She was ultimately ruined by her daughter’s six Alphas, left with a shattered family and no place to be buried.
Jiang Chuxie had no desire to follow in the original body’s footsteps. She didn’t want to be a scumbag, nor did she want to be killed. She just wanted to live peacefully… Wait, why does the person sleeping beside her look so much like… Gu Lingjun?
Jiang Chuxie couldn’t escape the fate of an ABO novel. Forced to marry due to pregnancy and reluctantly accepting her fate, the gentle Omega, who had always been submissive, suddenly changed drastically. She broke up, threw money at her, and ran off pregnant, turning the tables and making Jiang Chuxie the one who got played.
Jiang Chuxie: Wait, isn’t something off with this plot?
Gu Lingjun: If it’s off, that’s just right.

      <title>After Transmigrating Into a Book, I Was Forced to Play the Role of a Scumbag Alpha (GL)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Shen Hanzhi woke up and found herself transmigrated into a novel as the villainous Alpha with the same name. The original Shen Hanzhi forced Wen Jin, a pitiful female protagonist from a fallen family, to marry her. She plundered Wen Jin’s possessions, forcibly marked her, and, after growing bored, brought a lover home to provoke the already pregnant Wen Jin.
Wen Jin lost her child and was imprisoned by Shen Hanzhi in a villa; she was completely blackened. Later, with the help of the male protagonist Liang Shuo, Wen Jin escaped the Shen family and ruined Shen Hanzhi’s reputation, leaving her as a madwoman on the streets.
Shen Hanzhi received the original novel’s plot. When she regained her senses, she was putting a wedding ring on Wen Jin’s finger. She turned to flee the wedding scene, but before she could move, her central nervous system received a shock.
Along with the shock, a strange voice echoed in her mind: The host cannot act out of character, or the villainous Alpha system will judge it as immediate death. At this, Shen Hanzhi felt completely numb!
Thus, Shen Hanzhi and Wen Jin’s daily life became like this:
Shen Hanzhi glared fiercely at Wen Jin: “You wrote my name so uglily, so you must write it ten more times as punishment!”
Shen Hanzhi stared at the delicate girl on the bed with a harsh tone: “I told you eight hundred times to eat more green peppers for nutrition, but you picked them out again!”
Wen Jin lived in a quagmire. She was an illegitimate daughter treated as a shame by the Wen family, living worse than a dog. Before leaving the Wen family at nineteen, she couldn’t even read.
A woman named Shen Hanzhi taught her to read, took her to various places to have fun, and gave her the life a person should have. Her Sister Shen was perfect in every way, except her tone sometimes sounded fierce.
But when Wen Jin watched TV, she understood it was the flirtation between wives, so she wasn’t afraid. When Wen Jin turned twenty, Shen Hanzhi finally accumulated enough villainous Alpha points to divorce the girl and live her own life.
But the girl hugged her neck and coquettishly said: “Sister, I like it when you bully me.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Yu Heyi received a wedding invitation from the Omega she had secretly loved for years, she was lying in a hospital bed.
She got into a car accident during a race and had to retire.
Under the double blow, Yu Heyi accepted her mom’s suggestion.
Going on a blind date.
Her mom praised the other person like crazy, saying they were a perfect Omega, beautiful and soft and gentle.
Then…
She found out the blind date was her most hated person, no one else came close!
Her love rival—Chi Ruixi.
She still hadn’t figured out how her beta love rival turned into an Omega.
And on the day of the blind date, she marked her.
It was Chi Ruixi, crying and begging her to mark her…
Afterward, Yu Heyi said three things.
“I’ll take responsibility, I’ll fulfill an Alpha’s duties.”
“I’ll treat you well, I’ll be considerate.”
“But don’t expect love.”
Chi Ruixi heard this, gave a slight smile, and said, “No need.”
Jobless Yu Heyi was arranged by her mom to work as a chef in the cafeteria of XX Middle School.
She found out the gentle and delicate literature teacher was—Chi Ruixi?
But Chi Ruixi’s cold words made her feel weird, a bit uncomfortable.
Yu Heyi thought it was pheromones that drew her to Chi Ruixi, otherwise why would she find
Chi Ruixi, the bridesmaid at the wedding, way more charming than the bride she’d loved for years.
Then, in a daze, she permanently marked Chi Ruixi.
Chi Ruixi kept waiting for that dumb Alpha to admit she loved her, but her dumb Alpha was truly dumb.

      <description><![CDATA[Zhou Yining died suddenly after 17 hours of intense work. When she woke up, she found herself transported into a romance novel, becoming the self-conscious and sensitive female lead.
The original character was a student at Nanchuan City No. 1 High School with average grades but secretly in love with the male lead, Zhang Ye. This caused the female supporting characters in the book to viciously slander her and even bully her at school. Among them, the one who hated the original character the most was the wealthy heiress Jiang Xianzhi.
After enduring persecution from her family, a series of school bullying incidents, and a physically and emotionally abusive relationship with the male lead, the original character finally achieved a happy ending with him.
Thinking about the original plot, Zhou Yining almost laughed in anger. That shitty male lead?
She didn’t care for him at all. It was her senior year, and clearly, the teachers hadn’t assigned enough homework if there was still time for this useless romantic nonsense.
Zhou Yining tore the original plot apart. She studied hard, aiming to top every subject. She rejected her family’s moral manipulation, gathered evidence to send those who bullied the original character to justice, and kicked the male lead, who loved to act cool for no reason, to the curb.
As she fought her way forward, she realized that the rich girl who used to hate her was actually kind of cute. When she got close, the rich girl would even blush?
Jiang Xianzhi realized she didn’t hate Zhou Yining anymore. Ever since Zhou Yining came back from being sick, she’d been acting strange. She wasn’t afraid of Jiang Xianzhi anymore and sometimes said weird things that made Jiang Xianzhi’s face turn red.
So Jiang Xianzhi’s daily life became:
September 2: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 3: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 4: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red…
September 13: After more than ten days of defeat, the rich girl decided to stand up for herself!
But on September 14, she was still teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red!

She was a straight woman, crossed into a porn game she played years ago.
She wondered why the hell it was a modified version.
Did it want to drive her mad?
——
Wei Qing calmed her mood and often looked at the obedient cute girl with loving eyes.
She nodded satisfactorily—she was a good child.
Wei Qing drank the water the girl handed her without caution.
She went to bed and felt especially sleepy today.
She grew somewhat drowsy...

      <description><![CDATA[Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.
Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.
Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.
Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.
The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…
The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.
That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.
<hr />
Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.
Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.
At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.
He could smile, she realised, but not for her.
From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.
Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.
<hr />
After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.
But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.
On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”
Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”
Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.
For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[General Qi Ren, known as the "Mad Wolf" was once an undefeated war god. However, he was poisoned by an enemy spy on the battlefield, which left him mentally impaired, leading to the tragic downfall of a legendary hero. The Emperor, relieved to have neutralized this formidable threat to his throne, felt a twinge of guilt. Hearing rumors that the "madman" harbored affection for the timid and mute Seventh Prince, Fu Yu'an, the Emperor decided to arrange their marriage, believing it to be a benevolent gesture.  
However, after the wedding, Fu Yu'an, who had to play both father and mother to the seemingly foolish general, was shocked when he saw the "madman" climbing into his bed with clear, calculating eyes. Fu Yu'an kicked him off and exclaimed, "You're not a fool?"  
To which Qi Ren retorted, "And you're not mute, are you? We're both hiding our true selves—so why the disdain?"

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><em>Choi Muk-hyun</em></strong> – The infamous ‘cleaner’ for Samun Group, a crime syndicate known for its dirty dealings. Born as an illegitimate child of a chaebol family, he’s made his name in the shadows but is left with nothing but the reputation of being human trash. With no hope left in life, he drifts through each day in dull indifference.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Female Lead:</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><em>Irang</em></strong> – The hidden child of a district attorney famous for his integrity. A sunflower who’s always lived in the shadows. Her one dying wish is to step into the light, just once, before she goes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Story Introduction</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To me, the world was nothing more than a small, closed-off room.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A life where I had no say in anything at all.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At the edge of my life, melting away like candle wax, I was quietly dying.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And then, one day, a man opened the door and walked in.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Calm down. You’re bleeding.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He was the first person who ever looked at me like that.’</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Will you come with me?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why—<em>without even knowing who he was</em>—I grabbed his coat without hesitation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you think I’m a good person or a bad person?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He was cold, frightening, and a complete stranger.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“A… good person.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, it didn’t matter if he was bad.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As long as he could take me away from here.</p>]]></description>

<i>“You’re in for huge bad luck. Really big trouble.”</i><i></i>
To stop this bad luck, Jisoo must meet a “big man.” It sounds silly— but then she really meets him. Chae Juwon is handsome and too charming to trust.
“I’ll tell you now— I don’t know why you’re here, but I’m not interested. I never sleep with people the old man sets me up with.”<i></i>
Juwon is bold and sly. He shocks Jisoo the first time they meet. And by accident, she finds out that the “big” rumor about him is true.
“So, did you get my number just to try it out?”<i></i>
Jisoo just wants a quiet life, but Juwon keeps pulling her into trouble. Still, in this mess, she finds new chances and feelings she can’t ignore.
“Why are you so kind to me, Mr. Chae?”
“I don’t know. I just want to be kind to you, Ms. Shin.”
As her biggest problem gets closer, this man keeps showing up. Can Jisoo really grab her “big luck” — or will it run away again?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Male Lead:</strong> <em>Kang Tae-shin</em> — owner of 4, Cheonghae-dong 118-gil. His work is as unusual as his mysterious aura.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Female Lead:</strong> <em>Woo Seula</em> — her life turned upside down after a sudden outbreak on her skin. While desperately looking for a cure, she crosses paths with Kang Taeshin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When to Read:</strong> When you want a romantic comedy wrapped up in exorcism and fate.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Story Intro</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Woo Seula’s whole body suddenly breaks out in a rash, and no doctor can explain. After trying everything she can think of, she finally goes to see a shaman — and finds out what she has is called Mudoo.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Following the shaman’s instructions, she heads to Cheonghae-dong 118-gil 4 — and that’s where she meets a man named Kang Tae-shin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Seula, I’d like you to help me with my work.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t work at night. I’m a morning person — I need to stick to a routine and be active during the day.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Three days from now. Ten at night. Come to Cheonghae-dong.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">She thought he was just some weirdo — but after meeting him, the Mudoo clears up completely, and her body feels light again.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Except… now she’s seeing things she shouldn’t be seeing — and panic sets in.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it really that scary, seeing what’s in front of you?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“…Can’t you make it so I don’t see them again?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Just pretend you don’t see, don’t hear, don’t feel anything. Act exactly like you did before your third eye opened.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A man whose true nature is a mystery — Kang Tae-shin — and Donggil, a talking dog who claims he’s a spirit.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Living with them, Seula has no choice but to exorcise ghosts — in this strange, chilly story full of secrets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Still, if you ever get too scared… come to me.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Tonight, I’ll come pick you up.”</p>]]></description>

Wen Zhao transmigrated into a low-magic Xianxia novel, only to discover she'd become the cannon fodder second female lead who bullied the female lead, seduced the male lead, and was generally a green tea b*tch, lotus-flower-like antagonist.
In the original novel, she was the catalyst for misunderstandings between the male and female leads, a dedicated tool character who lived until the grand finale. In the end, the male and female leads ended up together, while she suffered the consequences.
To avoid a bad ending, Wen Zhao tried her best to cling to the female lead without being too out of character, hoping to safely exit the story.
Although she was still being required by the system to perform actions befitting a second female lead, Wen Zhao believed the female lead would eventually understand her sincere heart!
However, it seemed like the female lead was looking at her a bit strangely?
••••
Male Lead: A Zhao, I suddenly realized that I might actually like you a little.
Wen Zhao: ???
She thought this was the biggest deviation from the plot, but then the female lead slowly approached.
Lowering her gaze slightly, the female lead, whose gaze was usually cold, revealed a hint of obsession and possessiveness. She walked up to Wen Zhao and smiled softly.
She asked softly, "A Zhao, between him and me, who do you choose?"
Wen Zhao: I choose you! I choose you!

Seven years ago, Yan Wei rejected the confession of her classmate Jiang Youyi, using the excuse that she was straight.
On the eve of the college entrance exams, Jiang Youyi took sleeping pills and was rushed to the hospital, but died despite all efforts to save her. Her belongings included only a diary and a confession letter that she hadn't given out on her seventeenth birthday.

There was still one year and three months until the college entrance exams.
She wanted to try and keep her.

Things to Know Before Reading:
1. Slow burn, high sweetness, a ratio of nine parts sugar to one part angst, guaranteed Happy Ending (HE)
2. Reformed fake straight top student VS forbearing rebellious tsundere, leaning towards realistic drama, a daily high school romance of mutual redemption, with sweet after-story of changing fate as adults.

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Qing wakes up to find herself transported into an ancient famine novel, becoming a shameless rogue. During a famine, the original host scams food and drink in the city, committing all sorts of evil deeds. With an innocent and harmless face, she tricks the distressed Jiang Jinhuang into marrying her. After the marriage, the original host’s true nature is revealed. When Jiang Jinhuang refuses to consummate the marriage, the host relentlessly pressures and torments her, even nearly strangling Jiang Jinhuang’s younger sister to death. After enduring countless hardships, Jiang Jinhuang finally returns to the capital, where her family and childhood friend deal with the original host, whose final destination is a mass grave outside the city.
Ye Qing, having received the entire plot, plans to stay far away from Jiang Jinhuang and live well in this ancient world. But just as she prepares to leave, her personal system activates, unlocking the spatial ability from her previous life. Unlike before, her space now includes land and a spiritual spring. The system tells her that by earning Jiang Jinhuang’s favor, she can gain rewards to ensure she won’t starve during the famine.
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 potato seeds;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with a 2-pound carp;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 eggs…
Through her efforts, Ye Qing helps Jiang Jinhuang and her sister thrive during the famine. When she successfully escorts Jiang Jinhuang back to the capital and prepares to leave alone, Jiang Jinhuang’s eyes redden with tears.
Jiang Jinhuang, the daughter of the Minister of Rites, is separated from her family during a visit to Linzhou when they are scattered by rioters. After many struggles, she reaches Linzhou but fails to find her relatives. Lost and desperate, she believes Ye Qing’s words and temporarily marries her. However, after the marriage, Ye Qing becomes a different person, constantly abusing her. Then, one day, Ye Qing suddenly changes for the better, protecting Jiang Jinhuang and her sister, ensuring they never go hungry. Later, Ye Qing even escorts them back to the capital. When Ye Qing tries to leave, Jiang Jinhuang blocks the door, her fox-like eyes staring at Ye Qing with an unreadable expression, saying, “Where do you think you’re going, abandoning me?”

      <description><![CDATA[When Yu Jing was 19 years old, she still hadn’t differentiated, but it didn’t affect her image as a beautiful and strong Alpha in the eyes of her fans.
Three years after her debut, she won over a huge group of loyal fans while somehow gaining an enemy—actress Ming Zhu, known as the queen of ratings.
Ming Zhu was an Alpha; sheclashed with Yu Jing at an event, and Yu Jing thought they’d never cross paths again. But, by some twist of fate, they were invited to the same reality show.
Before filming even started, their fans were already tearing each other apart on Weibo.
Yu Jing couldn’t resist checking the comments and got angrier the more she read.
She could accept being called a has-been, and she could tolerate accusations of riding Ming Zhu’s fame. But someone dared question her gender, saying she’d definitely differentiate as an Omega???
Yu Jing suppressed the urge to jump into the fray, secretly swearing: Once I differentiate into a top-tier Alpha, I’ll crush all you haters and your idol into the ground!
Then she differentiated into a delicate Omega.
And got pinned against the wall by Ming Zhu.
In an intimate room—
Ming Zhu’s fingers brushed over the fragile skin hiding her gland, looking down at the person in her arms, her tone soft: “Are you okay?”
Yu Jing’s hands weakly clung to her neck, her cheeks flushed, her voice soft and pleading:
“Mark me already, please.”
<hr />
<strong>Warnings:</strong>
1. Lots of original world-building, Alphas don’t have male anatomy.
2. Melodramatic plot, slow-burn romance, proceed with caution if it’s not your thing.

      <title>Dressed as the Scumbag Alpha Mom of the Tragic Female Lead (ABO, GL)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[What made Jiang Chuxie collapse even more than transmigrating into a blood-type novel was that she became the scumbag Alpha dad of the book’s female lead… or rather, mom?
The scumbag Alpha mom relied on the female lead’s mother, Gu Lingjun, to rise to wealth and prominence. She teamed up with her mistress to kill the original wife and seize the family fortune that should have belonged to the female lead, setting the stage for the female lead’s tragic life.
As for the ending, this scumbag Alpha naturally didn’t fare well either. She was ultimately ruined by her daughter’s six Alphas, left with a shattered family and no place to be buried.
Jiang Chuxie had no desire to follow in the original body’s footsteps. She didn’t want to be a scumbag, nor did she want to be killed. She just wanted to live peacefully… Wait, why does the person sleeping beside her look so much like… Gu Lingjun?
Jiang Chuxie couldn’t escape the fate of an ABO novel. Forced to marry due to pregnancy and reluctantly accepting her fate, the gentle Omega, who had always been submissive, suddenly changed drastically. She broke up, threw money at her, and ran off pregnant, turning the tables and making Jiang Chuxie the one who got played.
Jiang Chuxie: Wait, isn’t something off with this plot?
Gu Lingjun: If it’s off, that’s just right.

      <description><![CDATA[Yu Heyi received a wedding invitation from the Omega she had secretly loved for years, she was lying in a hospital bed.
She got into a car accident during a race and had to retire.
Under the double blow, Yu Heyi accepted her mom’s suggestion.
Going on a blind date.
Her mom praised the other person like crazy, saying they were a perfect Omega, beautiful and soft and gentle.
Then…
She found out the blind date was her most hated person, no one else came close!
Her love rival—Chi Ruixi.
She still hadn’t figured out how her beta love rival turned into an Omega.
And on the day of the blind date, she marked her.
It was Chi Ruixi, crying and begging her to mark her…
Afterward, Yu Heyi said three things.
“I’ll take responsibility, I’ll fulfill an Alpha’s duties.”
“I’ll treat you well, I’ll be considerate.”
“But don’t expect love.”
Chi Ruixi heard this, gave a slight smile, and said, “No need.”
Jobless Yu Heyi was arranged by her mom to work as a chef in the cafeteria of XX Middle School.
She found out the gentle and delicate literature teacher was—Chi Ruixi?
But Chi Ruixi’s cold words made her feel weird, a bit uncomfortable.
Yu Heyi thought it was pheromones that drew her to Chi Ruixi, otherwise why would she find
Chi Ruixi, the bridesmaid at the wedding, way more charming than the bride she’d loved for years.
Then, in a daze, she permanently marked Chi Ruixi.
Chi Ruixi kept waiting for that dumb Alpha to admit she loved her, but her dumb Alpha was truly dumb.

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon waking, Shen Chiying discovered she was the vicious supporting villainess in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">His Majesty Regrets Too Late</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“He gave the empress’s seat that should have been hers to her concubine-born younger sister.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, on a night of torrential rain, the emperor stood alone outside a mountain temple, waiting in the cold for her forgiveness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after seizing the realm, Huan Jin’s heart from beginning to end held only the little girl who once helped him escape with his life.”</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And Shen Chiying just happens to be the heroine’s malicious concubine-born sister…</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the book she’s willful and overbearing, big tits and no brains; to climb onto the newly enthroned male lead, she claims the heroine’s life-saving debt as her own.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One lie demands a hundred more, and Shen Chiying starts courting death—again and again framing her legitimate elder sister, the heroine.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end she reaps what she sowed: deposed from the empress’s seat, thrown into a dungeon, tortured daily by every cruel device, unable to live, unable to die.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing the plot ahead of time, Shen Chiying works all the harder when she serves in bed—eyes wet and sultry, obediently arching her perky ass to tend the dragon cock.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Majesty, there’s something this concubine wishes to confess…”</span>

      <description><![CDATA[Gu Yu Qi, a daughter born to a marquis household. She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky. It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.
But what happened to her in the end?
For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.
If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.
Who knew he’d be reborn again…
When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky. Just what are you playing at!?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In the book, she is a useless person from a poor family. Because she is easy to control, Lu Zijin chooses her to be the redundant Alpha of the Lu family.
Originally, she could have just enjoyed the easy life provided, but she gradually became greedy. She not only covets the Lu family’s wealth but also wants to make the female lead, Lu Zijin, submit to her. She tries to harm Lu Zijin several times, but each attempt is exposed. In the end, Lu Zijin and her childhood friend break both of Wei Lan’s legs and throw her out of the Lu family.
A few days later, she dies.
Wei Lan frowns as she looks at the original book’s content: Is the easy life not good enough, or is jade not worth carving? Why would you go and provoke the female lead for no reason?
Learning her lesson, Wei Lan strictly follows the rules Lu Zijin sets for her, never crossing the line or actively seeking Lu Zijin’s attention. She rarely goes out, always holding a few unremarkable stones that she carves.
At first, Lu Zijin finds this redundant Alpha well-behaved. She only allows Wei Lan to share her bed during the heat period and sends her away afterward. Wei Lan never complains.
But gradually, Lu Zijin feels differently about this redundant Alpha. Even after the heat period, she enjoys being around Wei Lan. However, Wei Lan always declines because of the few rough stones she carries, making Lu Zijin dislike those stones.
Over the past year, the most popular jade carver in the Great Zhou Dynasty is Qing Lan. This carver is extremely mysterious, rarely appearing in public. Even when she does, she wears a mask and a wide black hooded cloak, hiding her face.
Her carvings are highly sought after and fetch high prices.
One evening, the so-called redundant Alpha who lives off others returns. Wei Lan holds a stack of silver notes, her eyes sparkling as she looks at Lu Zijin: “Wife, I sold my carved ornaments for a good price again.”
Lu Zijin looks at Wei Lan with gentle eyes: “Good job, very obedient. There’ll be a reward later.”

      <description><![CDATA["Every day, a recurring hellish dream. Junseong is stuck in a world that feels like an endless loop, much like a roguelike game. It's a cursed world where he struggles every day. Two months have passed since he set foot in the zombie apocalypse world in his dreams. "Ha...." As soon as he woke up, his gaze was instinctively drawn to the internet broadcast that he habitually left on. -A major riot is occurring in some regions due to the current situation... Then, beep! A loud sound announcing a disaster alert echoed in Junseong's head. Unconsciously picking up his phone along with the alarm sound, Junseong couldn't hide his confused expression.
[10:44 AM] It was the exact time he had always woken up in his dream. Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. "I've been wanting to ask you something."
"What?" As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo's gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. "Why do you look at me like that?" Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. "How am I... looking at you?"
"...." Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the 'fake smile' he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of blood was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of blood from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his 'clothes' but emanated from him.``]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[When Yu Jing was 19 years old, she still hadn’t differentiated, but it didn’t affect her image as a beautiful and strong Alpha in the eyes of her fans.
Three years after her debut, she won over a huge group of loyal fans while somehow gaining an enemy—actress Ming Zhu, known as the queen of ratings.
Ming Zhu was an Alpha; sheclashed with Yu Jing at an event, and Yu Jing thought they’d never cross paths again. But, by some twist of fate, they were invited to the same reality show.
Before filming even started, their fans were already tearing each other apart on Weibo.
Yu Jing couldn’t resist checking the comments and got angrier the more she read.
She could accept being called a has-been, and she could tolerate accusations of riding Ming Zhu’s fame. But someone dared question her gender, saying she’d definitely differentiate as an Omega???
Yu Jing suppressed the urge to jump into the fray, secretly swearing: Once I differentiate into a top-tier Alpha, I’ll crush all you haters and your idol into the ground!
Then she differentiated into a delicate Omega.
And got pinned against the wall by Ming Zhu.
In an intimate room—
Ming Zhu’s fingers brushed over the fragile skin hiding her gland, looking down at the person in her arms, her tone soft: “Are you okay?”
Yu Jing’s hands weakly clung to her neck, her cheeks flushed, her voice soft and pleading:
“Mark me already, please.”

<strong>Warnings:</strong>
1. Lots of original world-building, Alphas don’t have male anatomy.

"Like you have a leg disease. I have insomnia. Shall we help each other as patients?"
Using Seokju's insomnia as an excuse, Ajin fell asleep in his embrace, becoming accustomed to his body temperature. "I want to work at your place until I die." "Then just stay here. Here, in my room, sit on my knees. Let me bring the world to this room. But doubts keep sprouting, despite sealing the cracks of happiness."
"Ajin, you can't leave this room until you've paid off all your debts." Now, this room became Ajin's world, yet he found solace in the fact that Seokju didn't abandon him.]]></description>

      <title>Don't Provoke the Black Lotus O [Transmigration Novel]</title>

      <description><![CDATA[A light-hearted, humorous, face-slapping, satisfying read.
A quirky and clever Alpha × a cold, black lotus Omega.
Jiang Ci transmigrated into the role of a cannon-fodder villain in an ancient ABO novel.
The original body, a prestigious first-rank military marquis with illustrious battle achievements, married the female lead out of lust for her beauty.
After marriage, his true nature was revealed: he imprisoned and abused her, and as a womanizer, he filled his courtyard with concubines, favoring them over his wife... In the end, he was mutilated by the blackened princess, who removed his gland, severed his limbs, and locked him in a pitch-dark dungeon.
When Jiang Ci transmigrated, she found herself straddling the female lead, engaged in unspeakable acts.
Jiang Ci immediately revealed her true self: "I'm not Gao Yi! I won't take the blame for this! I can even prove it by breakdancing!"
Female lead: "???"
The system issued a task: "Please fix the messed-up plot, torment the female lead, and promote her descent into darkness."
Jiang Ci: "No time for you."
System: "???"
…
Jiang Ci had been single for over twenty years and had only ever liked one fictional character.
Now that she had transmigrated into her lord, how could she not seize this heaven-sent opportunity?
No matter who you are, she would confront heaven and earth, and teach a lesson to anyone who bullied the female lead!
After all, she had become the villain—it would be a shame not to act domineering and arrogant!
She gave her all to the female lead, protecting her at every turn, helping her build her career, and imparting all her skills... Only to eventually realize that she was just a substitute, that the female lead had always harbored a white moonlight in her heart.
All the ambiguity between them was because she resembled that person.
Jiang Ci: "Can I know who she is?"
Female lead: "No."
Jiang Ci was finally numb. Heartbroken and disillusioned, she exchanged rewards with the system and returned to her original world.
…
Later, the woman who had ascended to the pinnacle of power got drunk at a palace banquet. "Have you found her?"
Maid: "Your Highness has forgotten, she was a soul transmigrator, not belonging to this world. We don't even know her real name."
The wine cup fell to the ground, and the woman's eyes dimmed.
…
When Jiang Ci woke up again, she found herself still in the novel, but now she had transmigrated into her own body, and ten years had passed.
The young girl she once needed to protect had now become the powerful and influential Grand Princess. It was said that this Grand Princess was cold and aloof, with her only peculiar hobby being to capture those with eccentric personalities and suspected of having delusions.
Jiang Ci wanted nothing to do with the Grand Princess this time and tried her best to keep her identity hidden.
However, the Grand Princess, after ten years, had thoroughly studied all of Jiang Ci's tactics, surpassing her teacher and excelling even further.

      <description><![CDATA[Noah, a masochist who enjoys pain. One day, due to his father's arbitrary decision, he is forced into an arranged political marriage with a man named Ian Miller...
"...Ah, I got it right this time? Yeah, I'll use this for my fiancé. What of it?" Ian's voice continued soothingly. "Even if I just torment him a little, that young master will run off crying to his daddy. If he's an alpha, he might even be traumatized."
In this world, is this a dream or reality? Is my fiancé now buying adult toys from my favorite club just to torment me? That sounded far more alluring and sweet than any love confession Noah had ever heard. Noah immediately changed the resolve he had just made to not marry Ian Miller. Someone who would even pluck a star from the sky for him is nothing special, and someone who hates him is nothing special either, but someone who will torment him is most welcome. This marriage must happen! It absolutely must! The delusion and love between a lovable, cute masochist and a lone, serious bad guy!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Shen Hanzhi woke up and found herself transmigrated into a novel as the villainous Alpha with the same name. The original Shen Hanzhi forced Wen Jin, a pitiful female protagonist from a fallen family, to marry her. She plundered Wen Jin’s possessions, forcibly marked her, and, after growing bored, brought a lover home to provoke the already pregnant Wen Jin.
Wen Jin lost her child and was imprisoned by Shen Hanzhi in a villa; she was completely blackened. Later, with the help of the male protagonist Liang Shuo, Wen Jin escaped the Shen family and ruined Shen Hanzhi’s reputation, leaving her as a madwoman on the streets.
Shen Hanzhi received the original novel’s plot. When she regained her senses, she was putting a wedding ring on Wen Jin’s finger. She turned to flee the wedding scene, but before she could move, her central nervous system received a shock.
Along with the shock, a strange voice echoed in her mind: The host cannot act out of character, or the villainous Alpha system will judge it as immediate death. At this, Shen Hanzhi felt completely numb!
Thus, Shen Hanzhi and Wen Jin’s daily life became like this:
Shen Hanzhi glared fiercely at Wen Jin: “You wrote my name so uglily, so you must write it ten more times as punishment!”
Shen Hanzhi stared at the delicate girl on the bed with a harsh tone: “I told you eight hundred times to eat more green peppers for nutrition, but you picked them out again!”
Wen Jin lived in a quagmire. She was an illegitimate daughter treated as a shame by the Wen family, living worse than a dog. Before leaving the Wen family at nineteen, she couldn’t even read.
A woman named Shen Hanzhi taught her to read, took her to various places to have fun, and gave her the life a person should have. Her Sister Shen was perfect in every way, except her tone sometimes sounded fierce.
But when Wen Jin watched TV, she understood it was the flirtation between wives, so she wasn’t afraid. When Wen Jin turned twenty, Shen Hanzhi finally accumulated enough villainous Alpha points to divorce the girl and live her own life.
But the girl hugged her neck and coquettishly said: “Sister, I like it when you bully me.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Zhou Yining died suddenly after 17 hours of intense work. When she woke up, she found herself transported into a romance novel, becoming the self-conscious and sensitive female lead.
The original character was a student at Nanchuan City No. 1 High School with average grades but secretly in love with the male lead, Zhang Ye. This caused the female supporting characters in the book to viciously slander her and even bully her at school. Among them, the one who hated the original character the most was the wealthy heiress Jiang Xianzhi.
After enduring persecution from her family, a series of school bullying incidents, and a physically and emotionally abusive relationship with the male lead, the original character finally achieved a happy ending with him.
Thinking about the original plot, Zhou Yining almost laughed in anger. That shitty male lead?
She didn’t care for him at all. It was her senior year, and clearly, the teachers hadn’t assigned enough homework if there was still time for this useless romantic nonsense.
Zhou Yining tore the original plot apart. She studied hard, aiming to top every subject. She rejected her family’s moral manipulation, gathered evidence to send those who bullied the original character to justice, and kicked the male lead, who loved to act cool for no reason, to the curb.
As she fought her way forward, she realized that the rich girl who used to hate her was actually kind of cute. When she got close, the rich girl would even blush?
Jiang Xianzhi realized she didn’t hate Zhou Yining anymore. Ever since Zhou Yining came back from being sick, she’d been acting strange. She wasn’t afraid of Jiang Xianzhi anymore and sometimes said weird things that made Jiang Xianzhi’s face turn red.
So Jiang Xianzhi’s daily life became:
September 2: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 3: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 4: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red…
September 13: After more than ten days of defeat, the rich girl decided to stand up for herself!
But on September 14, she was still teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red!
