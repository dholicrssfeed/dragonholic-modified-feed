      <description><![CDATA[Gu Yu Qi, a daughter born to a marquis household. She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky. It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.
But what happened to her in the end?
For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.
If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.
Who knew he’d be reborn again…
When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky. Just what are you playing at!?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.
After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor's chest: "Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?"
The new emperor kissed her: "You will be fine, just love me."
The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: "Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left."
When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess's obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official's wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.
Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.
------
The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.
Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.
For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, "The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated," before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. Blood poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.
When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.
Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: "Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?"
"... She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore."
Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: "She said she won't fight, so the fight is over?"

      <title>Don't Provoke the Black Lotus O [Transmigration Novel]</title>
      <volume/>
      <chaptername>Chapter 29</chaptername>

      <description><![CDATA[A light-hearted, humorous, face-slapping, satisfying read.
A quirky and clever Alpha × a cold, black lotus Omega.
Jiang Ci transmigrated into the role of a cannon-fodder villain in an ancient ABO novel.
The original body, a prestigious first-rank military marquis with illustrious battle achievements, married the female lead out of lust for her beauty.
After marriage, his true nature was revealed: he imprisoned and abused her, and as a womanizer, he filled his courtyard with concubines, favoring them over his wife... In the end, he was mutilated by the blackened princess, who removed his gland, severed his limbs, and locked him in a pitch-dark dungeon.
When Jiang Ci transmigrated, she found herself straddling the female lead, engaged in unspeakable acts.
Jiang Ci immediately revealed her true self: "I'm not Gao Yi! I won't take the blame for this! I can even prove it by breakdancing!"
Female lead: "???"
The system issued a task: "Please fix the messed-up plot, torment the female lead, and promote her descent into darkness."
Jiang Ci: "No time for you."
System: "???"
…
Jiang Ci had been single for over twenty years and had only ever liked one fictional character.
Now that she had transmigrated into her lord, how could she not seize this heaven-sent opportunity?
No matter who you are, she would confront heaven and earth, and teach a lesson to anyone who bullied the female lead!
After all, she had become the villain—it would be a shame not to act domineering and arrogant!
She gave her all to the female lead, protecting her at every turn, helping her build her career, and imparting all her skills... Only to eventually realize that she was just a substitute, that the female lead had always harbored a white moonlight in her heart.
All the ambiguity between them was because she resembled that person.
Jiang Ci: "Can I know who she is?"
Female lead: "No."
Jiang Ci was finally numb. Heartbroken and disillusioned, she exchanged rewards with the system and returned to her original world.
…
Later, the woman who had ascended to the pinnacle of power got drunk at a palace banquet. "Have you found her?"
Maid: "Your Highness has forgotten, she was a soul transmigrator, not belonging to this world. We don't even know her real name."
The wine cup fell to the ground, and the woman's eyes dimmed.
…
When Jiang Ci woke up again, she found herself still in the novel, but now she had transmigrated into her own body, and ten years had passed.
The young girl she once needed to protect had now become the powerful and influential Grand Princess. It was said that this Grand Princess was cold and aloof, with her only peculiar hobby being to capture those with eccentric personalities and suspected of having delusions.
Jiang Ci wanted nothing to do with the Grand Princess this time and tried her best to keep her identity hidden.
However, the Grand Princess, after ten years, had thoroughly studied all of Jiang Ci's tactics, surpassing her teacher and excelling even further.

      <title>Transmigrating Before The Crazy Beauty Scum A Loses Control</title>
      <volume/>

      <description><![CDATA[Summary 1:
"Even if it's a one-for-one trade, I will take over his company."
These were the last words Luan Yenan said before transmigrating into a book.
As the sole head of a Fortune 500 investment company, she never expected her end to be dying from overwork after three sleepless days and nights, only to transmigrate into a novel.
The character she transmigrated into was a crazy, abusive Alpha who tormented the female lead before having her glands removed by the seemingly innocent but secretly cunning female lead.
Crazy? Perfect, I’m crazy too.
Abusive Alpha? Sorry, I’m single and not interested.
As for the female lead, are you talking about the little girl I’ve pinned down, teary-eyed and begging for mercy?
Seemingly innocent but secretly cunning? Interesting.
Let me personally train her. I want to see how she plans to cut out my glands.
Summary 2:
Zuo Baixuan, who had just differentiated into an Omega, was sold by her adoptive parents to a crazy, abusive Alpha. She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.
Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, "I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early."
After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.
One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: "I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce."
Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: "I’ve already graduated."
"So?"
"I want to have a child. With you."
Let’s see who’s really the crazy one.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Ani belongs to a nearly extinct species with unparalleled mimicry abilities.
In order to survive, she joins the infamous interstellar live-streamed hunting game, taking on the form of a seemingly ordinary human girl—wide-eyed, innocent, and sweetly smiling.
No one expects such a fragile-looking human to last more than three days.
Yet, as the months pass, the audience watches in growing horror. Not only has this delicate girl survived, but she has fought her way into the finals. The once-dominant warriors, who were the center of attention, now flinch at the mere mention of her name, instinctively retreating as if facing their natural predator.
——————————
Ani bears the heavy responsibility of continuing her species. She is the last of her kind.
To ensure her race’s survival, she must seek out the strongest and most exceptional beings across the universe to reproduce with.
While her opponents view her as an enemy in a life-or-death battle, Ani has already begun her own special hunt.
Within her hunting grounds, blood turns sweet, pain transforms into pleasure, and slaughter weaves an inescapable web of desire.
And those caught in her web? They become hers—completely.
——————————
At some point, the prey began to come to her willingly.
A man who was once formidable and battle-hardened, grasps her hand, and pressed it against his abdomen, willingly giving up his body for her to alter. He, who once struck fear across the battlefield, now stands before her with an almost desperate plea.
His voice is low, uncertain, yet filled with expectation.
“Ani… You will take responsibility right?”

      <description><![CDATA["Every day, a recurring hellish dream. Junseong is stuck in a world that feels like an endless loop, much like a roguelike game. It's a cursed world where he struggles every day. Two months have passed since he set foot in the zombie apocalypse world in his dreams. "Ha...." As soon as he woke up, his gaze was instinctively drawn to the internet broadcast that he habitually left on. -A major riot is occurring in some regions due to the current situation... Then, beep! A loud sound announcing a disaster alert echoed in Junseong's head. Unconsciously picking up his phone along with the alarm sound, Junseong couldn't hide his confused expression.
[10:44 AM] It was the exact time he had always woken up in his dream. Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. "I've been wanting to ask you something."
"What?" As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo's gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. "Why do you look at me like that?" Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. "How am I... looking at you?"
"...." Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the 'fake smile' he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of blood was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of blood from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his 'clothes' but emanated from him.``]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[At the princess's banquet, in a secluded hall, Helan Ci pressed her palm against the wall, encountering the equally disheveled newly crowned top scholar Lu Wuyou. One was as delicate as a willow, the other had a flushed face.
Their eyes met, and in each other's gaze, they saw a glimmer of despair.
"I'll go first..."
"I'll head that way..."
However, what was even more despairing was the sound of the princess's maid and the second prince's attendant searching for them not far away.
Helan Ci bit her lip: "What don't you just go to the princess?"
Lu Wuyou endured: "I think the second prince is not bad either."
Helan Ci: "If we keep talking, we'll only end up hurting each other!"
Lu Wuyou closed his eyes: "Then let it be a mutual destruction."
Helan Ci: "…?"
A night later, their innocence was lost, and they were forced into marriage. Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband's demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.
Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”
Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to. Who told me to marry you— I’m going to be a powerful minister. I can’t fall here.”
Helan Ci, “Then do your best! I’m counting on you!”
Lu Wuyou, “…?”
Years later, Lu Wuyou became the Prime Minister, holding the highest position among officials, wielding immense power across the land, and reflecting on the past.
A student asked him how he had come this far.
Prime Minister Lu thought to himself that as long as one marries a wife of extraordinary beauty, often coveted by others, it would always inspire one to strive to make progress.

Han's simple daily life working part-time at a convenience store is suddenly turned upside down.
"Your debt amounts to a total of one hundred million and seven thousand."
With a timid and fearful personality, Han is unwittingly drawn into the world of the 'Tasenda' club to repay the massive debt he incurred. There, he meets Jang Taesin, a man who is a perfect fit for the depths of darkness.
From the moment Taesin laid eyes on Han, he was inexplicably drawn to him and began to obsessively pursue him, offering a proposal to keep him from escaping.
"I'll stay by your side only until I get tired of you. Once I'm tired of your body, I'll consider your debt paid and let you go."
"How long will it take for you to get tired of me?"
"About twenty times, and I won't get tired."
However, instead of getting tired, the thirst only grew stronger.
He wanted to see, touch, and possess him. Once he had his body, he found himself desiring his heart as well.
"Why don't I ever get to see that cheap smile of yours?"
"You'll never see me smile in front of you, even if I die."
Taesin couldn't understand why Han hated him so much, and Han couldn't fathom Taesin's obsession with him.
Thus, the tangled threads of a complex relationship began to weave between the two, as distant from the end of the world as they could be. Can these two people, who seem so far apart from the rest of the world, really be together?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Jeong Yeo-won wakes up from a frozen state.
When I opened my eyes, I found myself woke up 500 years later in a world that had already been destroyed.
A monster suddenly appears from the gate.
'Esper', a godlike creature who has awakened his powers follow its lead.
And the world is completely different from the past. Humans are no longer the masters of the Earth.
The Espers, who are supposed to hunt monsters and protect the city, are actually leading the world to further destruction due to their rampage. The 'Guides' that could calm the Espers have already disappeared.
But then.
"I'm a guide?"
The only guide who miraculously woke up in a discarded hibernation capsule.
Yeo-won creates a guiding drug that slows down the rampage and distributes it around the world.
Thus, the world is one step away from destruction,
but now she must protect herself from the espers who seek to find and possess the guide.
A drop of water that falls on dry land,
Will it be able to moisten the earth, or will it dry up and disappear in the heat.]]></description>

"...Ah, I got it right this time? Yeah, I'll use this for my fiancé. What of it?" Ian's voice continued soothingly. "Even if I just torment him a little, that young master will run off crying to his daddy. If he's an alpha, he might even be traumatized."
In this world, is this a dream or reality? Is my fiancé now buying adult toys from my favorite club just to torment me? That sounded far more alluring and sweet than any love confession Noah had ever heard. Noah immediately changed the resolve he had just made to not marry Ian Miller. Someone who would even pluck a star from the sky for him is nothing special, and someone who hates him is nothing special either, but someone who will torment him is most welcome. This marriage must happen! It absolutely must! The delusion and love between a lovable, cute masochist and a lone, serious bad guy!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao died tragically.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The man she had saved and cared for for many years despised her and shattered her spirit veins with his own hands and dissolved her body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. I have waited for this day.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan's ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And Ning Yao's lifelong wish is to ascend.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft—those fools don’t know his worth. He’s from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it works, great. If not… well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions. When that happens, their instincts will turn against their beloved, giving rise to an uncontrollable urge to kill.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slay one’s beloved, attain enlightenment, ascend immediately, and forget the past.</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfect outcome for both.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao knew that Feng Jingzhuo had already begun to grow his heart’s scales.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, he endured the agonizing pain, hiding away to claw open his own chest. He ripped out the endlessly growing scales, pinned his own hands down with bone nails—desperately resisting his dragon instincts.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I beg you… whatever you do, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’ll be over soon. Be good. Stay outside…”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside, Ning Yao pondered, if</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we can both ascend, that’s better than neither of us ascending at all.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, she went in.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as she always did, she held him in her arms, kissing his trembling, pale lips with tenderness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After many 10 thousand years, Ning Yao was reborn and successfully ascended.</span>
She forgot Feng Jingzhou, but he remembered her.
Tormenting himself, he wanted to turn back time.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao was very happy, but the ceremony of conferring the gods was a little simple.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the entire world of gods was busy trying to stop a fallen god who wants to activate the forbidden Time-Reversal Array.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Theme: My heart is controlled by me, not by heavens.</span>

This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.
No! I don't want you to express it with your body either!]]></description>

The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this world, there exist beings known as "Ability Users." However, in such a world, a boy named Task was judged to have no abilities and was branded as a failure—an F-Rank. At the academy that trains Ability Users, he was the lowest of the low, the only student unable to participate in combat training.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But one day, he was noticed by the legendary and most powerful mentor, Ken Misaki, who, despite being an "ability-less" master, recognized Task’s talent for combat techniques. As a result, Task was given the chance to participate in the academy’s prestigious "Rank Festival."</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As he fights his way up from the very bottom, Task begins to awaken his hidden potential and steadily rises to become the academy’s strongest warrior.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">—"I'm not just dreaming of greatness—I'm going to become it!!"</span>

      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/with-multiple-babies-who-still-wants-to-be-the-marquesss-wife/chapter-39/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Everyone in the capital knew that the Marquess’s wife, Lan Qingxi, was despised by her in-laws, abused by her mother-in-law, and merely a plaything of the treacherous Song Linyuan. People expected her to be divorced, thrown into a pond, and abandoned, ending up in a pitiful state. But one day, when Lan Qingxi was about to leave the Marquess’s residence, Song Linyuan waited at the door, wiping the dust from her shoes, carefully helping her into the bridal sedan, and leading a procession to marry her. That’s when everyone realized they had misjudged the situation.
After their marriage, Song Linyuan said, “Madam, it’s rumored in the capital that I fear my wife.”
Lan Qingxi innocently replied, “Who has the audacity to spread such rumors about the Prime Minister? Drag them out and execute them.”
Song Linyuan: “I did.”
Lan Qingxi: “……”
Lan Qingxi’s saying: Successfully performing in front of a scumbag is called lying. Successfully performing in front of Song Linyuan is called winning at life.

      <title>Transmigrating Before The Crazy Beauty Scum A Loses Control</title>
      <volume/>
      <chaptername>Chapter 23</chaptername>

      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/transmigrating-before-the-crazy-beauty-scum-a-loses-control/chapter-23/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Summary 1:
"Even if it's a one-for-one trade, I will take over his company."
These were the last words Luan Yenan said before transmigrating into a book.
As the sole head of a Fortune 500 investment company, she never expected her end to be dying from overwork after three sleepless days and nights, only to transmigrate into a novel.
The character she transmigrated into was a crazy, abusive Alpha who tormented the female lead before having her glands removed by the seemingly innocent but secretly cunning female lead.
Crazy? Perfect, I’m crazy too.
Abusive Alpha? Sorry, I’m single and not interested.
As for the female lead, are you talking about the little girl I’ve pinned down, teary-eyed and begging for mercy?
Seemingly innocent but secretly cunning? Interesting.
Let me personally train her. I want to see how she plans to cut out my glands.
Summary 2:
Zuo Baixuan, who had just differentiated into an Omega, was sold by her adoptive parents to a crazy, abusive Alpha. She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.
Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, "I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early."
After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.
One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: "I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce."
Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: "I’ve already graduated."
"So?"
"I want to have a child. With you."
Let’s see who’s really the crazy one.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[At the princess's banquet, in a secluded hall, Helan Ci pressed her palm against the wall, encountering the equally disheveled newly crowned top scholar Lu Wuyou. One was as delicate as a willow, the other had a flushed face.
Their eyes met, and in each other's gaze, they saw a glimmer of despair.
"I'll go first..."
"I'll head that way..."
However, what was even more despairing was the sound of the princess's maid and the second prince's attendant searching for them not far away.
Helan Ci bit her lip: "What don't you just go to the princess?"
Lu Wuyou endured: "I think the second prince is not bad either."
Helan Ci: "If we keep talking, we'll only end up hurting each other!"
Lu Wuyou closed his eyes: "Then let it be a mutual destruction."
Helan Ci: "…?"
A night later, their innocence was lost, and they were forced into marriage. Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband's demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.
Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”
Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to. Who told me to marry you— I’m going to be a powerful minister. I can’t fall here.”
Helan Ci, “Then do your best! I’m counting on you!”
Lu Wuyou, “…?”
Years later, Lu Wuyou became the Prime Minister, holding the highest position among officials, wielding immense power across the land, and reflecting on the past.
A student asked him how he had come this far.
Prime Minister Lu thought to himself that as long as one marries a wife of extraordinary beauty, often coveted by others, it would always inspire one to strive to make progress.

      <title>Mistakenly Treated The Princess As A Concubine</title>

      <description><![CDATA[After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing'an Marquis's residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle's family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke's residence was snatched away by her stepsister.
After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.
The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.
This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.
The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.
To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.
However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.
When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.
The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.
It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.
She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.
While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.
Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!
————
At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.
At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.
The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.
Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.
And all the girl asked for in return was—
"Sister, kiss me."
"Sister, hug me."
"Sister, cuddle me."
The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.
Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl's "concubine" while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.
————
Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.
Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.
“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”
Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!
What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!
With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!
She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”
She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”
She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”

      <title>The Male Lead's Harem Belongs to Me (GL)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Jiang Han died from staying up too late reading a novel, and after her death, she found herself transported into the ancient melodramatic romance novel she had been reading.
The male lead is a cold and domineering prince, and the female lead is the prince's long-cherished "white moonlight". Unfortunately, the white moonlight has a lowly status, and the prince's mother disapproves. The male lead goes to great lengths, enduring countless melodramatic events, heart-wrenching and physically exhausting, ultimately winning the heart of his beloved and achieving a happy ending. And Jiang Han is one of the cannon fodder female characters who, out of jealousy, targeted the male lead's white moonlight.
Jiang Han, who traveled through time, said: "No way, I just want to be a salted fish and play mahjong every day."
So when the male lead said: "I want to marry my white moonlight."
Jiang Han: Marry! You must marry! The gifts are all ready.
The male lead said: "She is timid and frail. As the princess, you should take good care of her."
Jiang Han: Take care! Must take care of !Tomorrow, I'll have her live next to me!
The male lead said: "She's too considerate. She won't speak up about her needs, so you should be more accommodating to her."
Jiang Han: Move! Must yield! Tomorrow, I will divorce you and give the title of princess to her!
••••
The next day, Jiang Han indeed handed him a divorce letter. The male lead, feeling complicated, signed it, but Jiang Han happily prepared to leave. Just as she reached the gate of the mansion, a group of concubines led by White Moonlight blocked her way.
White Moonlight: Sister Jiang, don't go. Would you stay?
A group of concubines: Yeah, yeah, please don't leave.
Jiang Han showed a troubled expression, and the male lead's heart was filled with joy. Just as he was about to say a few words of persuasion, he saw Jiang Han decisively shake her head.
The male lead thought it was a pity. Before he could catch his breath, he saw the person he held dear, his "white moonlight," take out a divorce agreement and coldly say to him, "Sign it. I want to leave with Sister Jiang."
The male lead stared wide-eyed in disbelief, a mouthful of old blood choked in his chest. However, the next moment, his group of concubines gritted their teeth and said to White Moonlight: "Weiwei, you are being too ungrateful. Why did you prepare the divorce papers all by yourself without telling us?"
#My harem seems to have turned into my princess's, what should I do#
#Is it too late to regret now#
••••
One-on-one [highlight this], before the divorce, they were just pure revolutionary comrades and good friends. After the divorce, there will be romantic developments.]]></description>

One of the delinquents rushed over and hugged her, pointed at her and scolding in a loud voice, “Are you blind! Why did you run onto the road!”

Yes, she was blind. The little blind girl burst into tears, her throat choking up, and the soft cloth on her eyes slipped off.

The delinquent boy looked straight at her, “F*ck me?”

“Let go… of me.” The little blind girl struggled against him.

The delinquent boy looked at her pretty face and gulped, “What’s your name? Tell me, and I’ll let you go.”

“…S-Su Ruan.” The little blind girl cried.
&nbsp;
“F*ck…” The delinquent boy l**ked the tip of his teeth and looked down at the tent in his pants. His voice had even become a little hoarse. “What a coincidence. My name is Hella Hard.”]]></description>

Li Suimei knew that Qin Qing would disdain to attend her engagement ceremony with Qin Zhan.
After all, as a vicious female supporting character, Li Suimei’s role as a stepping stone for the male and female leads was almost over.
Why would Qin Qing come to help her?
Li Suimei chuckled bitterly. She had heard rumors about Qin Qing being very protective of her loved ones, but she didn't know who had spread those rumors.
——At the engagement ceremony, Qin Qing, who was originally not supposed to attend, suddenly appeared. Wearing a snow-white wedding dress, she stood in the position that should have belonged to the male protagonist and said expressionlessly,
"Now, you are my wife."
Li Suimei: "..."
Didn't this person seem indifferent towards her just yesterday?
••••
Small Theater:
Qin Qing pinched Li Suimei's wrist, her gaze fierce, "Back then, I always thought, you invited me to dinner and movies, stayed up late with me to go through documents, hugged my arm and cried, calling me 'sister.' Whenever I got angry, you would get nervous, and you even walked in and out of my room in your pajamas. If that wasn't love, what was it?"
Li Suimei looked confused, "When did I bent?"

In this world where magic reigns supreme, there's a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a 'stud' in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<strong>Lee Su</strong> was trapped in a building on a deserted island.
She had no memories, no recollection of how she got here.
She was rescued by one of the survivors of a plane crash that took place on the island.
<strong>Hayden Wight</strong>. A young gentleman from the United Kingdom. Representative of a security company.
Meeting him could have been a blessing, giving her the chance to escape from vicious criminals.
From his eyes to his lips and his whole body, the man also seemed to want to give her a chance to start a new life.
***
“I don’t know my name or my age. I don’t even know what kinds of danger I am in. That’s why it’s a bit difficult for me to be next to a man.”
Lee Seo expressed concern.
“I mean, you could also be in danger if you were to get involved with me.”
A warm breeze blew in from the sea.
As the sand particles began to fly through the air, Hayden covered Lee Su’s face with his hand and replied,
“Then I’ll have to receive higher compensation. I don’t intend for you to pay me with your body, so you can rest easy.”
Unlike usual, Lee Su could barely control her expression. The memory of last night suddenly came to mind.
His blue eyes focused on Lee Seo.
“Y-you’re staring at me like a filthy beast.” Lee Su stammered, unable to respond properly.
Just then, the question that followed took her breath away.
<em>“Who was it that pretended to be asleep and turned me on?”</em>
She knew he had seen it all last night.

However, he was poisoned by an enemy spy on the battlefield, which left him mentally impaired, leading to the tragic downfall of a legendary hero. The Emperor, relieved to have neutralized this formidable threat to his throne, felt a twinge of guilt. Hearing rumors that the "madman" harbored affection for the timid and mute Seventh Prince, Fu Yu'an, the Emperor decided to arrange their marriage, believing it to be a benevolent gesture.  
However, after the wedding, Fu Yu'an, who had to play both father and mother to the seemingly foolish general, was shocked when he saw the "madman" climbing into his bed with clear, calculating eyes. Fu Yu'an kicked him off and exclaimed, "You're not a fool?"  
To which Qi Ren retorted, "And you're not mute, are you? We're both hiding our true selves—so why the disdain?"

      <description><![CDATA[A light-hearted, humorous, face-slapping, satisfying read.
A quirky and clever Alpha × a cold, black lotus Omega.
Jiang Ci transmigrated into the role of a cannon-fodder villain in an ancient ABO novel.
The original body, a prestigious first-rank military marquis with illustrious battle achievements, married the female lead out of lust for her beauty.
After marriage, his true nature was revealed: he imprisoned and abused her, and as a womanizer, he filled his courtyard with concubines, favoring them over his wife... In the end, he was mutilated by the blackened princess, who removed his gland, severed his limbs, and locked him in a pitch-dark dungeon.
When Jiang Ci transmigrated, she found herself straddling the female lead, engaged in unspeakable acts.
Jiang Ci immediately revealed her true self: "I'm not Gao Yi! I won't take the blame for this! I can even prove it by breakdancing!"
Female lead: "???"
The system issued a task: "Please fix the messed-up plot, torment the female lead, and promote her descent into darkness."
Jiang Ci: "No time for you."
System: "???"
…
Jiang Ci had been single for over twenty years and had only ever liked one fictional character.
Now that she had transmigrated into her lord, how could she not seize this heaven-sent opportunity?
No matter who you are, she would confront heaven and earth, and teach a lesson to anyone who bullied the female lead!
After all, she had become the villain—it would be a shame not to act domineering and arrogant!
She gave her all to the female lead, protecting her at every turn, helping her build her career, and imparting all her skills... Only to eventually realize that she was just a substitute, that the female lead had always harbored a white moonlight in her heart.
All the ambiguity between them was because she resembled that person.
Jiang Ci: "Can I know who she is?"
Female lead: "No."
Jiang Ci was finally numb. Heartbroken and disillusioned, she exchanged rewards with the system and returned to her original world.
…
Later, the woman who had ascended to the pinnacle of power got drunk at a palace banquet. "Have you found her?"
Maid: "Your Highness has forgotten, she was a soul transmigrator, not belonging to this world. We don't even know her real name."
The wine cup fell to the ground, and the woman's eyes dimmed.
…
When Jiang Ci woke up again, she found herself still in the novel, but now she had transmigrated into her own body, and ten years had passed.
The young girl she once needed to protect had now become the powerful and influential Grand Princess. It was said that this Grand Princess was cold and aloof, with her only peculiar hobby being to capture those with eccentric personalities and suspected of having delusions.
Jiang Ci wanted nothing to do with the Grand Princess this time and tried her best to keep her identity hidden.
However, the Grand Princess, after ten years, had thoroughly studied all of Jiang Ci's tactics, surpassing her teacher and excelling even further.

      <description><![CDATA[Bai Zhi is an eunuch—a fake eunuch.
In her past life, the empress bestowed upon her a wife, the princess of a fallen kingdom. However, when the crown prince attempted to assault her wife, he was killed in self-defense.
In the end, the fake eunuch and the princess of the fallen kingdom met their fate by being beheaded in public, their lives filled with humiliation and absurdity.
When Bai Zhi opened her eyes again, she found herself reborn one year earlier, when the beautiful and tragic princess of the fallen kingdom had just been tied up and thrown onto her bed.
This time, she only wanted to survive, but as she tried to leave, she was stopped.
The princess, with teary eyes, clutched her sleeve and asked, "Husband, won’t you take me with you?"
Bai Zhi replied, "From now on, I can only live a hard life of farming. You should find your own way."
Princess: "I am willing to accompany you in a life of men plowing and women weaving."
Bai Zhi: "..." But I am a woman!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao died tragically.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The man she had saved and cared for for many years despised her and shattered her spirit veins with his own hands and dissolved her body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. I have waited for this day.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan's ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And Ning Yao's lifelong wish is to ascend.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft—those fools don’t know his worth. He’s from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it works, great. If not… well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions. When that happens, their instincts will turn against their beloved, giving rise to an uncontrollable urge to kill.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slay one’s beloved, attain enlightenment, ascend immediately, and forget the past.</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfect outcome for both.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao knew that Feng Jingzhuo had already begun to grow his heart’s scales.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, he endured the agonizing pain, hiding away to claw open his own chest. He ripped out the endlessly growing scales, pinned his own hands down with bone nails—desperately resisting his dragon instincts.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I beg you… whatever you do, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’ll be over soon. Be good. Stay outside…”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside, Ning Yao pondered, if</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we can both ascend, that’s better than neither of us ascending at all.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, she went in.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as she always did, she held him in her arms, kissing his trembling, pale lips with tenderness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After many 10 thousand years, Ning Yao was reborn and successfully ascended.</span>
She forgot Feng Jingzhou, but he remembered her.
Tormenting himself, he wanted to turn back time.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao was very happy, but the ceremony of conferring the gods was a little simple.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the entire world of gods was busy trying to stop a fallen god who wants to activate the forbidden Time-Reversal Array.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Theme: My heart is controlled by me, not by heavens.</span>

      <description><![CDATA[Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.
After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor's chest: "Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?"
The new emperor kissed her: "You will be fine, just love me."
The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: "Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left."
When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess's obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official's wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.
Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.
------
The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.
Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.
For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, "The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated," before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. Blood poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.
When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.
Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: "Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?"
"... She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore."
Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: "She said she won't fight, so the fight is over?"

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">At a party, during a game of Truth or Dare, Ning Xin‘er chose Dare. She scanned the room and locked eyes on the most handsome guy in the booth. Boldly, she walked over and lightly said, "Hey handsome, can you do me a favor and give me a kiss?" Her first act of boldness in life resulted in the man's relentless pursuit: "You kissed me; now you must take responsibility." Thus, Ning Xin’er's first romance as an adult began, by accident…</span>]]></description>

      <title>After Transmigrating, I and the Female Lead Both Found It 'Really Fragrant' (GL)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Shen Qiqi, a prolific author of female-led novels, was known for her love of torturing the female leads in her stories. She would make the female leads suffer, become isolated, and ultimately turn to the dark side before making a triumphant return.
Never in her wildest dreams did she imagine she would be transported into one of her own novels, turning into a mediocre and vicious cannon fodder—a junior sister who delighted in bullying the female lead and was eventually hung on the city wall as punishment.
To survive, she decided to become a carefree and laid-back player, knowing and daring nothing. However, upon seeing the female lead for the first time, she instantly fell head over heels.
To shower the female lead with love and warmth, Shen Qiqi went out of her way to protect her:
* When the female lead was bullied by other vicious cannon fodder, she was the first to help her fight back.
* When the female lead was wronged, she felt heartbroken.
* When the female lead was pursued by a scumbag, she... broke them up!
Meanwhile, Liu Shuang had been reborn with a cold heart, viewing everyone around her as insignificant ants.
Fortunately, she still possessed the magic from her previous life. In this new life, everything remained unchanged except for her once arrogant and overbearing junior sister, who now revolved around her, showering her with flattery and affection.
Using her mind-reading ability, she overheard the junior sister's thoughts:
"OMG, the female lead is so beautiful! I can do this!"
"My senior sister is kind, gentle, and understanding. No one can hurt her!"
"Senior sister, don't be so saintly. You'll be bullied by bad people!"
The Demon Lord Liu Shuang: ??? I'd rather jump off a building than believe Shen Qiqi again! ... My junior sister is so cute, I'm so into her.
A carefree, optimistic, appearance-obsessed salted fish vs. a cold-on-the-outside-but-warm-on-the-inside, beautiful and powerful Demon Lord
1v1 HE, light-hearted and sweet]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[To survive, Sheng Nuan must traverse different worlds, playing the role of self-destructive cannon fodder while saving the darkest villains. These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand. Holding the cannon fodder's script, Sheng Nuan is terrified...
Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Synopsis: </span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin Yuran never would have thought that the client sitting across from her, forcing them both to work together, was the high school classmate she had rejected long ago, Chi Ye.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two maintained a distant yet courteous relationship, keeping their distance as they worked together.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Lin Yuran gradually felt something wasn't quite right.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, why did this man insist on her working at his company instead of her own studio? And moreover, how come her office just so happened to be directly opposite his?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another instance, when Lin Yuran accepted a ride in another man's Rolls-Royce Phantom, Chi Ye only sighed, "I thought I'd never get to ride a luxury car like this in my life."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The very next day, Chi Ye's car changed to a Bentley, then Bugatti, followed by Koenigsegg... Another time, Lin Yuran accidentally stumbled upon Chi Ye's Baidu profile and discovered that her favorite lollipop factory was registered under his name.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But rumor had it that the factory closed five years ago, and that some mysterious big shot loved eating these lollipops, so he bought the factory and continued production regardless of profit or loss, no matter what the situation.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous clues led Lin Yuran to suspect—</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chi Ye still liked her?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Little did she know, even their second encounter was part of his plan.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Chi Ye remained unaware that on that sweltering afternoon six years ago, Lin Yuran had quietly watched his lonely figure from afar and murmured softly, "If we meet again someday, I hope I can respond to you."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, only the wind heard her confession.</span>]]></description>

In her past life, the empress bestowed upon her a wife, the princess of a fallen kingdom. However, when the crown prince attempted to assault her wife, he was killed in self-defense.
In the end, the fake eunuch and the princess of the fallen kingdom met their fate by being beheaded in public, their lives filled with humiliation and absurdity.
When Bai Zhi opened her eyes again, she found herself reborn one year earlier, when the beautiful and tragic princess of the fallen kingdom had just been tied up and thrown onto her bed.
This time, she only wanted to survive, but as she tried to leave, she was stopped.
The princess, with teary eyes, clutched her sleeve and asked, "Husband, won’t you take me with you?"
Bai Zhi replied, "From now on, I can only live a hard life of farming. You should find your own way."
Princess: "I am willing to accompany you in a life of men plowing and women weaving."
Bai Zhi: "..." But I am a woman!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The man I had a drunken one-night stand with turned out to be the male lead from the original story. The issue? This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.
No! I don't want you to express it with your body either!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Lin Chu, an engineering student, was following a novel and found the villain character especially compelling. When she read the part where the villain was forced to marry a manipulative woman during his downfall, Lin Chu couldn’t help but criticize the green tea character.
Who would have expected that she’d black out, only to become that very same troublesome woman who regretted her marriage to the villain on their wedding day and ultimately got herself killed?
Lin Chu: “…”
Stay calm, don’t panic.
Looking at the villainous husband, injured and returning from the battlefield, Lin Chu thought she had found her chance to escape her tragic fate by clinging to his leg for survival…

      <title>Giving Interstellar Players a Horror Ghost Game Shock</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!
What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!
With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!
She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”
She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”
She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”
Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”
Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”

In this world where magic reigns supreme, there's a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a 'stud' in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.
Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.
Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.
Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.
The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…
The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.
That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.
<hr />
Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.
Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.
At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.
He could smile, she realised, but not for her.
From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.
Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.
<hr />
After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.
But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.
On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”
Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”
Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.
For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.]]></description>

However, he was poisoned by an enemy spy on the battlefield, which left him mentally impaired, leading to the tragic downfall of a legendary hero. The Emperor, relieved to have neutralized this formidable threat to his throne, felt a twinge of guilt. Hearing rumors that the "madman" harbored affection for the timid and mute Seventh Prince, Fu Yu'an, the Emperor decided to arrange their marriage, believing it to be a benevolent gesture.  
However, after the wedding, Fu Yu'an, who had to play both father and mother to the seemingly foolish general, was shocked when he saw the "madman" climbing into his bed with clear, calculating eyes. Fu Yu'an kicked him off and exclaimed, "You're not a fool?"  
To which Qi Ren retorted, "And you're not mute, are you? We're both hiding our true selves—so why the disdain?"

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Wen Zhao transmigrated into a low-magic Xianxia novel, only to discover she'd become the cannon fodder second female lead who bullied the female lead, seduced the male lead, and was generally a green tea b*tch, lotus-flower-like antagonist.
In the original novel, she was the catalyst for misunderstandings between the male and female leads, a dedicated tool character who lived until the grand finale. In the end, the male and female leads ended up together, while she suffered the consequences.
To avoid a bad ending, Wen Zhao tried her best to cling to the female lead without being too out of character, hoping to safely exit the story.
Although she was still being required by the system to perform actions befitting a second female lead, Wen Zhao believed the female lead would eventually understand her sincere heart!
However, it seemed like the female lead was looking at her a bit strangely?
••••
Male Lead: A Zhao, I suddenly realized that I might actually like you a little.
Wen Zhao: ???
She thought this was the biggest deviation from the plot, but then the female lead slowly approached.
Lowering her gaze slightly, the female lead, whose gaze was usually cold, revealed a hint of obsession and possessiveness. She walked up to Wen Zhao and smiled softly.
She asked softly, "A Zhao, between him and me, who do you choose?"
Wen Zhao: I choose you! I choose you!
••••
One-Sentence Summary: Thank you everyone, I'm with the female lead now.
Theme: Even when facing difficulties, one should strive to overcome them and have the determination to reverse their situation. Only through hard work can one achieve success. Victory and new surprises are waiting not far away.]]></description>

      <title>Mistakenly Treated The Princess As A Concubine</title>

      <description><![CDATA[After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing'an Marquis's residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle's family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke's residence was snatched away by her stepsister.
After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.
The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.
This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.
The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.
To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.
However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.
When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.
The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.
It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.
She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.
While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.
Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!
————
At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.
At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.
The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.
Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.
And all the girl asked for in return was—
"Sister, kiss me."
"Sister, hug me."
"Sister, cuddle me."
The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.
Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl's "concubine" while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.
————
Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.
Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.
“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”
Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—]]></description>

It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.

So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.

      <description><![CDATA[Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.
After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor's chest: "Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?"
The new emperor kissed her: "You will be fine, just love me."
The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: "Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left."
When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess's obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official's wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.
Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.
------
The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.
Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.
For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, "The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated," before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. Blood poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.
When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.
Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: "Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?"
"... She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore."
Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: "She said she won't fight, so the fight is over?"

      <description><![CDATA[A light-hearted, humorous, face-slapping, satisfying read.
A quirky and clever Alpha × a cold, black lotus Omega.
Jiang Ci transmigrated into the role of a cannon-fodder villain in an ancient ABO novel.
The original body, a prestigious first-rank military marquis with illustrious battle achievements, married the female lead out of lust for her beauty.
After marriage, his true nature was revealed: he imprisoned and abused her, and as a womanizer, he filled his courtyard with concubines, favoring them over his wife... In the end, he was mutilated by the blackened princess, who removed his gland, severed his limbs, and locked him in a pitch-dark dungeon.
When Jiang Ci transmigrated, she found herself straddling the female lead, engaged in unspeakable acts.
Jiang Ci immediately revealed her true self: "I'm not Gao Yi! I won't take the blame for this! I can even prove it by breakdancing!"
Female lead: "???"
The system issued a task: "Please fix the messed-up plot, torment the female lead, and promote her descent into darkness."
Jiang Ci: "No time for you."
System: "???"
…
Jiang Ci had been single for over twenty years and had only ever liked one fictional character.
Now that she had transmigrated into her lord, how could she not seize this heaven-sent opportunity?
No matter who you are, she would confront heaven and earth, and teach a lesson to anyone who bullied the female lead!
After all, she had become the villain—it would be a shame not to act domineering and arrogant!
She gave her all to the female lead, protecting her at every turn, helping her build her career, and imparting all her skills... Only to eventually realize that she was just a substitute, that the female lead had always harbored a white moonlight in her heart.
All the ambiguity between them was because she resembled that person.
Jiang Ci: "Can I know who she is?"
Female lead: "No."
Jiang Ci was finally numb. Heartbroken and disillusioned, she exchanged rewards with the system and returned to her original world.
…
Later, the woman who had ascended to the pinnacle of power got drunk at a palace banquet. "Have you found her?"
Maid: "Your Highness has forgotten, she was a soul transmigrator, not belonging to this world. We don't even know her real name."
The wine cup fell to the ground, and the woman's eyes dimmed.
…
When Jiang Ci woke up again, she found herself still in the novel, but now she had transmigrated into her own body, and ten years had passed.
The young girl she once needed to protect had now become the powerful and influential Grand Princess. It was said that this Grand Princess was cold and aloof, with her only peculiar hobby being to capture those with eccentric personalities and suspected of having delusions.
Jiang Ci wanted nothing to do with the Grand Princess this time and tried her best to keep her identity hidden.
However, the Grand Princess, after ten years, had thoroughly studied all of Jiang Ci's tactics, surpassing her teacher and excelling even further.

      <description><![CDATA[<strong>Lee Su</strong> was trapped in a building on a deserted island.
She had no memories, no recollection of how she got here.
She was rescued by one of the survivors of a plane crash that took place on the island.
<strong>Hayden Wight</strong>. A young gentleman from the United Kingdom. Representative of a security company.
Meeting him could have been a blessing, giving her the chance to escape from vicious criminals.
From his eyes to his lips and his whole body, the man also seemed to want to give her a chance to start a new life.
***
“I don’t know my name or my age. I don’t even know what kinds of danger I am in. That’s why it’s a bit difficult for me to be next to a man.”
Lee Seo expressed concern.
“I mean, you could also be in danger if you were to get involved with me.”
A warm breeze blew in from the sea.
As the sand particles began to fly through the air, Hayden covered Lee Su’s face with his hand and replied,
“Then I’ll have to receive higher compensation. I don’t intend for you to pay me with your body, so you can rest easy.”
Unlike usual, Lee Su could barely control her expression. The memory of last night suddenly came to mind.
His blue eyes focused on Lee Seo.
“Y-you’re staring at me like a filthy beast.” Lee Su stammered, unable to respond properly.
Just then, the question that followed took her breath away.
<em>“Who was it that pretended to be asleep and turned me on?”</em>
She knew he had seen it all last night.

      <description><![CDATA[Summary 1:
"Even if it's a one-for-one trade, I will take over his company."
These were the last words Luan Yenan said before transmigrating into a book.
As the sole head of a Fortune 500 investment company, she never expected her end to be dying from overwork after three sleepless days and nights, only to transmigrate into a novel.
The character she transmigrated into was a crazy, abusive Alpha who tormented the female lead before having her glands removed by the seemingly innocent but secretly cunning female lead.
Crazy? Perfect, I’m crazy too.
Abusive Alpha? Sorry, I’m single and not interested.
As for the female lead, are you talking about the little girl I’ve pinned down, teary-eyed and begging for mercy?
Seemingly innocent but secretly cunning? Interesting.
Let me personally train her. I want to see how she plans to cut out my glands.
Summary 2:
Zuo Baixuan, who had just differentiated into an Omega, was sold by her adoptive parents to a crazy, abusive Alpha. She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.
Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, "I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early."
After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.
One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: "I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce."
Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: "I’ve already graduated."
"So?"
"I want to have a child. With you."
Let’s see who’s really the crazy one.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["Every day, a recurring hellish dream. Junseong is stuck in a world that feels like an endless loop, much like a roguelike game. It's a cursed world where he struggles every day. Two months have passed since he set foot in the zombie apocalypse world in his dreams. "Ha...." As soon as he woke up, his gaze was instinctively drawn to the internet broadcast that he habitually left on. -A major riot is occurring in some regions due to the current situation... Then, beep! A loud sound announcing a disaster alert echoed in Junseong's head. Unconsciously picking up his phone along with the alarm sound, Junseong couldn't hide his confused expression.
[10:44 AM] It was the exact time he had always woken up in his dream. Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. "I've been wanting to ask you something."
"What?" As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo's gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. "Why do you look at me like that?" Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. "How am I... looking at you?"
"...." Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the 'fake smile' he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of blood was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of blood from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his 'clothes' but emanated from him.``]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[※ This work contains immoral subject matter, violent acts, and descriptions of coercive relationships, among other things. Additionally, the settings, backgrounds, and characters in the work are all fictional. Please keep this in mind while enjoying the story.
Han's simple daily life working part-time at a convenience store is suddenly turned upside down.
"Your debt amounts to a total of one hundred million and seven thousand."
With a timid and fearful personality, Han is unwittingly drawn into the world of the 'Tasenda' club to repay the massive debt he incurred. There, he meets Jang Taesin, a man who is a perfect fit for the depths of darkness.
From the moment Taesin laid eyes on Han, he was inexplicably drawn to him and began to obsessively pursue him, offering a proposal to keep him from escaping.
"I'll stay by your side only until I get tired of you. Once I'm tired of your body, I'll consider your debt paid and let you go."
"How long will it take for you to get tired of me?"
"About twenty times, and I won't get tired."
However, instead of getting tired, the thirst only grew stronger.
He wanted to see, touch, and possess him. Once he had his body, he found himself desiring his heart as well.
"Why don't I ever get to see that cheap smile of yours?"
"You'll never see me smile in front of you, even if I die."
Taesin couldn't understand why Han hated him so much, and Han couldn't fathom Taesin's obsession with him.
Thus, the tangled threads of a complex relationship began to weave between the two, as distant from the end of the world as they could be. Can these two people, who seem so far apart from the rest of the world, really be together?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Jeong Yeo-won wakes up from a frozen state.
When I opened my eyes, I found myself woke up 500 years later in a world that had already been destroyed.
A monster suddenly appears from the gate.
'Esper', a godlike creature who has awakened his powers follow its lead.
And the world is completely different from the past. Humans are no longer the masters of the Earth.
The Espers, who are supposed to hunt monsters and protect the city, are actually leading the world to further destruction due to their rampage. The 'Guides' that could calm the Espers have already disappeared.
But then.
"I'm a guide?"
The only guide who miraculously woke up in a discarded hibernation capsule.
Yeo-won creates a guiding drug that slows down the rampage and distributes it around the world.
Thus, the world is one step away from destruction,
but now she must protect herself from the espers who seek to find and possess the guide.
A drop of water that falls on dry land,
Will it be able to moisten the earth, or will it dry up and disappear in the heat.]]></description>

Using Seokju's insomnia as an excuse, Ajin fell asleep in his embrace, becoming accustomed to his body temperature. "I want to work at your place until I die." "Then just stay here. Here, in my room, sit on my knees. Let me bring the world to this room. But doubts keep sprouting, despite sealing the cracks of happiness."

"...Ah, I got it right this time? Yeah, I'll use this for my fiancé. What of it?" Ian's voice continued soothingly. "Even if I just torment him a little, that young master will run off crying to his daddy. If he's an alpha, he might even be traumatized."
In this world, is this a dream or reality? Is my fiancé now buying adult toys from my favorite club just to torment me? That sounded far more alluring and sweet than any love confession Noah had ever heard. Noah immediately changed the resolve he had just made to not marry Ian Miller. Someone who would even pluck a star from the sky for him is nothing special, and someone who hates him is nothing special either, but someone who will torment him is most welcome. This marriage must happen! It absolutely must! The delusion and love between a lovable, cute masochist and a lone, serious bad guy!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao died tragically.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The man she had saved and cared for for many years despised her and shattered her spirit veins with his own hands and dissolved her body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. I have waited for this day.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan's ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And Ning Yao's lifelong wish is to ascend.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft—those fools don’t know his worth. He’s from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it works, great. If not… well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions. When that happens, their instincts will turn against their beloved, giving rise to an uncontrollable urge to kill.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slay one’s beloved, attain enlightenment, ascend immediately, and forget the past.</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfect outcome for both.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao knew that Feng Jingzhuo had already begun to grow his heart’s scales.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, he endured the agonizing pain, hiding away to claw open his own chest. He ripped out the endlessly growing scales, pinned his own hands down with bone nails—desperately resisting his dragon instincts.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I beg you… whatever you do, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’ll be over soon. Be good. Stay outside…”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside, Ning Yao pondered, if</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we can both ascend, that’s better than neither of us ascending at all.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, she went in.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as she always did, she held him in her arms, kissing his trembling, pale lips with tenderness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After many 10 thousand years, Ning Yao was reborn and successfully ascended.</span>
She forgot Feng Jingzhou, but he remembered her.
Tormenting himself, he wanted to turn back time.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao was very happy, but the ceremony of conferring the gods was a little simple.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the entire world of gods was busy trying to stop a fallen god who wants to activate the forbidden Time-Reversal Array.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Theme: My heart is controlled by me, not by heavens.</span>

      <description><![CDATA[<strong>Lee Su</strong> was trapped in a building on a deserted island.
She had no memories, no recollection of how she got here.
She was rescued by one of the survivors of a plane crash that took place on the island.
<strong>Hayden Wight</strong>. A young gentleman from the United Kingdom. Representative of a security company.
Meeting him could have been a blessing, giving her the chance to escape from vicious criminals.
From his eyes to his lips and his whole body, the man also seemed to want to give her a chance to start a new life.
***
“I don’t know my name or my age. I don’t even know what kinds of danger I am in. That’s why it’s a bit difficult for me to be next to a man.”
Lee Seo expressed concern.
“I mean, you could also be in danger if you were to get involved with me.”
A warm breeze blew in from the sea.
As the sand particles began to fly through the air, Hayden covered Lee Su’s face with his hand and replied,
“Then I’ll have to receive higher compensation. I don’t intend for you to pay me with your body, so you can rest easy.”
Unlike usual, Lee Su could barely control her expression. The memory of last night suddenly came to mind.
His blue eyes focused on Lee Seo.
“Y-you’re staring at me like a filthy beast.” Lee Su stammered, unable to respond properly.
Just then, the question that followed took her breath away.
<em>“Who was it that pretended to be asleep and turned me on?”</em>
She knew he had seen it all last night.

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this world, there exist beings known as "Ability Users." However, in such a world, a boy named Task was judged to have no abilities and was branded as a failure—an F-Rank. At the academy that trains Ability Users, he was the lowest of the low, the only student unable to participate in combat training.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But one day, he was noticed by the legendary and most powerful mentor, Ken Misaki, who, despite being an "ability-less" master, recognized Task’s talent for combat techniques. As a result, Task was given the chance to participate in the academy’s prestigious "Rank Festival."</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As he fights his way up from the very bottom, Task begins to awaken his hidden potential and steadily rises to become the academy’s strongest warrior.</span>

      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/with-multiple-babies-who-still-wants-to-be-the-marquesss-wife/chapter-38/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Everyone in the capital knew that the Marquess’s wife, Lan Qingxi, was despised by her in-laws, abused by her mother-in-law, and merely a plaything of the treacherous Song Linyuan. People expected her to be divorced, thrown into a pond, and abandoned, ending up in a pitiful state. But one day, when Lan Qingxi was about to leave the Marquess’s residence, Song Linyuan waited at the door, wiping the dust from her shoes, carefully helping her into the bridal sedan, and leading a procession to marry her. That’s when everyone realized they had misjudged the situation.
After their marriage, Song Linyuan said, “Madam, it’s rumored in the capital that I fear my wife.”
Lan Qingxi innocently replied, “Who has the audacity to spread such rumors about the Prime Minister? Drag them out and execute them.”
Song Linyuan: “I did.”
Lan Qingxi: “……”
Lan Qingxi’s saying: Successfully performing in front of a scumbag is called lying. Successfully performing in front of Song Linyuan is called winning at life.

      <title>Transmigrating Before The Crazy Beauty Scum A Loses Control</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Summary 1:
"Even if it's a one-for-one trade, I will take over his company."
These were the last words Luan Yenan said before transmigrating into a book.
As the sole head of a Fortune 500 investment company, she never expected her end to be dying from overwork after three sleepless days and nights, only to transmigrate into a novel.
The character she transmigrated into was a crazy, abusive Alpha who tormented the female lead before having her glands removed by the seemingly innocent but secretly cunning female lead.
Crazy? Perfect, I’m crazy too.
Abusive Alpha? Sorry, I’m single and not interested.
As for the female lead, are you talking about the little girl I’ve pinned down, teary-eyed and begging for mercy?
Seemingly innocent but secretly cunning? Interesting.
Let me personally train her. I want to see how she plans to cut out my glands.
Summary 2:
Zuo Baixuan, who had just differentiated into an Omega, was sold by her adoptive parents to a crazy, abusive Alpha. She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.
Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, "I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early."
After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.
One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: "I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce."
Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: "I’ve already graduated."
"So?"
"I want to have a child. With you."
Let’s see who’s really the crazy one.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing'an Marquis's residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle's family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke's residence was snatched away by her stepsister.
After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.
The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.
This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.
The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.
To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.
However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.
When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.
The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.
It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.
She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.
While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.
Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!
————
At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.
At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.
The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.
Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.
And all the girl asked for in return was—
"Sister, kiss me."
"Sister, hug me."
"Sister, cuddle me."
The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.
Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl's "concubine" while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.
————
Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.
Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.
“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”
Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—]]></description>

This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.
No! I don't want you to express it with your body either!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!
What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!
With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!
She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”
She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”
She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”
Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”
Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”

      <title>The Male Lead's Harem Belongs to Me (GL)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Jiang Han died from staying up too late reading a novel, and after her death, she found herself transported into the ancient melodramatic romance novel she had been reading.
The male lead is a cold and domineering prince, and the female lead is the prince's long-cherished "white moonlight". Unfortunately, the white moonlight has a lowly status, and the prince's mother disapproves. The male lead goes to great lengths, enduring countless melodramatic events, heart-wrenching and physically exhausting, ultimately winning the heart of his beloved and achieving a happy ending. And Jiang Han is one of the cannon fodder female characters who, out of jealousy, targeted the male lead's white moonlight.
Jiang Han, who traveled through time, said: "No way, I just want to be a salted fish and play mahjong every day."
So when the male lead said: "I want to marry my white moonlight."
Jiang Han: Marry! You must marry! The gifts are all ready.
The male lead said: "She is timid and frail. As the princess, you should take good care of her."
Jiang Han: Take care! Must take care of !Tomorrow, I'll have her live next to me!
The male lead said: "She's too considerate. She won't speak up about her needs, so you should be more accommodating to her."
Jiang Han: Move! Must yield! Tomorrow, I will divorce you and give the title of princess to her!
••••
The next day, Jiang Han indeed handed him a divorce letter. The male lead, feeling complicated, signed it, but Jiang Han happily prepared to leave. Just as she reached the gate of the mansion, a group of concubines led by White Moonlight blocked her way.
White Moonlight: Sister Jiang, don't go. Would you stay?
A group of concubines: Yeah, yeah, please don't leave.
Jiang Han showed a troubled expression, and the male lead's heart was filled with joy. Just as he was about to say a few words of persuasion, he saw Jiang Han decisively shake her head.
The male lead thought it was a pity. Before he could catch his breath, he saw the person he held dear, his "white moonlight," take out a divorce agreement and coldly say to him, "Sign it. I want to leave with Sister Jiang."
The male lead stared wide-eyed in disbelief, a mouthful of old blood choked in his chest. However, the next moment, his group of concubines gritted their teeth and said to White Moonlight: "Weiwei, you are being too ungrateful. Why did you prepare the divorce papers all by yourself without telling us?"
#My harem seems to have turned into my princess's, what should I do#
#Is it too late to regret now#
••••
One-on-one [highlight this], before the divorce, they were just pure revolutionary comrades and good friends. After the divorce, there will be romantic developments.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The little blind girl was stopped by a group of delinquents on the way home from school. The group of boys groped her breasts and even wanted to check if she was a virg*n. The little blind girl was so angry that she took out chili powder and sprayed it all over, then turned around and ran. She was completely lost and was almost hit by a car. One of the delinquents rushed over and hugged her, pointed at her and scolding in a loud voice, “Are you blind! Why did you run onto the road!”
&nbsp;
Yes, she was blind. The little blind girl burst into tears, her throat choking up, and the soft cloth on her eyes slipped off.
&nbsp;
The delinquent boy looked straight at her, “F*ck me?”
&nbsp;
“Let go… of me.” The little blind girl struggled against him.
&nbsp;
The delinquent boy looked at her pretty face and gulped, “What’s your name? Tell me, and I’ll let you go.”
&nbsp;
“…S-Su Ruan.” The little blind girl cried.
&nbsp;
“F*ck…” The delinquent boy l**ked the tip of his teeth and looked down at the tent in his pants. His voice had even become a little hoarse. “What a coincidence. My name is Hella Hard.”]]></description>

The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."

Li Suimei knew that Qin Qing would disdain to attend her engagement ceremony with Qin Zhan.
After all, as a vicious female supporting character, Li Suimei’s role as a stepping stone for the male and female leads was almost over.
Why would Qin Qing come to help her?
Li Suimei chuckled bitterly. She had heard rumors about Qin Qing being very protective of her loved ones, but she didn't know who had spread those rumors.
——At the engagement ceremony, Qin Qing, who was originally not supposed to attend, suddenly appeared. Wearing a snow-white wedding dress, she stood in the position that should have belonged to the male protagonist and said expressionlessly,
"Now, you are my wife."
Li Suimei: "..."
Didn't this person seem indifferent towards her just yesterday?
••••
Small Theater:
Qin Qing pinched Li Suimei's wrist, her gaze fierce, "Back then, I always thought, you invited me to dinner and movies, stayed up late with me to go through documents, hugged my arm and cried, calling me 'sister.' Whenever I got angry, you would get nervous, and you even walked in and out of my room in your pajamas. If that wasn't love, what was it?"
Li Suimei looked confused, "When did I bent?"

In this world where magic reigns supreme, there's a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a 'stud' in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?]]></description>

Hearing rumors that the "madman" harbored affection for the timid and mute Seventh Prince, Fu Yu'an, the Emperor decided to arrange their marriage, believing it to be a benevolent gesture.  
However, after the wedding, Fu Yu'an, who had to play both father and mother to the seemingly foolish general, was shocked when he saw the "madman" climbing into his bed with clear, calculating eyes. Fu Yu'an kicked him off and exclaimed, "You're not a fool?"

A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

      <title>Don't Provoke the Black Lotus O [Transmigration Novel]</title>
      <volume/>
      <chaptername>Chapter 26</chaptername>

      <description><![CDATA[A light-hearted, humorous, face-slapping, satisfying read.
A quirky and clever Alpha × a cold, black lotus Omega.
Jiang Ci transmigrated into the role of a cannon-fodder villain in an ancient ABO novel.
The original body, a prestigious first-rank military marquis with illustrious battle achievements, married the female lead out of lust for her beauty.
After marriage, his true nature was revealed: he imprisoned and abused her, and as a womanizer, he filled his courtyard with concubines, favoring them over his wife... In the end, he was mutilated by the blackened princess, who removed his gland, severed his limbs, and locked him in a pitch-dark dungeon.
When Jiang Ci transmigrated, she found herself straddling the female lead, engaged in unspeakable acts.
Jiang Ci immediately revealed her true self: "I'm not Gao Yi! I won't take the blame for this! I can even prove it by breakdancing!"
Female lead: "???"
The system issued a task: "Please fix the messed-up plot, torment the female lead, and promote her descent into darkness."
Jiang Ci: "No time for you."
System: "???"
…
Jiang Ci had been single for over twenty years and had only ever liked one fictional character.
Now that she had transmigrated into her lord, how could she not seize this heaven-sent opportunity?
No matter who you are, she would confront heaven and earth, and teach a lesson to anyone who bullied the female lead!
After all, she had become the villain—it would be a shame not to act domineering and arrogant!
She gave her all to the female lead, protecting her at every turn, helping her build her career, and imparting all her skills... Only to eventually realize that she was just a substitute, that the female lead had always harbored a white moonlight in her heart.
All the ambiguity between them was because she resembled that person.
Jiang Ci: "Can I know who she is?"
Female lead: "No."
Jiang Ci was finally numb. Heartbroken and disillusioned, she exchanged rewards with the system and returned to her original world.
…
Later, the woman who had ascended to the pinnacle of power got drunk at a palace banquet. "Have you found her?"
Maid: "Your Highness has forgotten, she was a soul transmigrator, not belonging to this world. We don't even know her real name."
The wine cup fell to the ground, and the woman's eyes dimmed.
…
When Jiang Ci woke up again, she found herself still in the novel, but now she had transmigrated into her own body, and ten years had passed.
The young girl she once needed to protect had now become the powerful and influential Grand Princess. It was said that this Grand Princess was cold and aloof, with her only peculiar hobby being to capture those with eccentric personalities and suspected of having delusions.
Jiang Ci wanted nothing to do with the Grand Princess this time and tried her best to keep her identity hidden.
However, the Grand Princess, after ten years, had thoroughly studied all of Jiang Ci's tactics, surpassing her teacher and excelling even further.

      <description><![CDATA[Bai Zhi is an eunuch—a fake eunuch.
In her past life, the empress bestowed upon her a wife, the princess of a fallen kingdom. However, when the crown prince attempted to assault her wife, he was killed in self-defense.
In the end, the fake eunuch and the princess of the fallen kingdom met their fate by being beheaded in public, their lives filled with humiliation and absurdity.
When Bai Zhi opened her eyes again, she found herself reborn one year earlier, when the beautiful and tragic princess of the fallen kingdom had just been tied up and thrown onto her bed.
This time, she only wanted to survive, but as she tried to leave, she was stopped.
The princess, with teary eyes, clutched her sleeve and asked, "Husband, won’t you take me with you?"
Bai Zhi replied, "From now on, I can only live a hard life of farming. You should find your own way."
Princess: "I am willing to accompany you in a life of men plowing and women weaving."
Bai Zhi: "..." But I am a woman!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.
After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor's chest: "Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?"
The new emperor kissed her: "You will be fine, just love me."
The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: "Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left."
When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess's obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official's wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.
Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.
------
The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.
Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.
For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, "The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated," before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. Blood poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.
When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.
Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: "Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?"
"... She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore."
Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: "She said she won't fight, so the fight is over?"

      <title>After Transmigrating, I and the Female Lead Both Found It 'Really Fragrant' (GL)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Shen Qiqi, a prolific author of female-led novels, was known for her love of torturing the female leads in her stories. She would make the female leads suffer, become isolated, and ultimately turn to the dark side before making a triumphant return.
Never in her wildest dreams did she imagine she would be transported into one of her own novels, turning into a mediocre and vicious cannon fodder—a junior sister who delighted in bullying the female lead and was eventually hung on the city wall as punishment.
To survive, she decided to become a carefree and laid-back player, knowing and daring nothing. However, upon seeing the female lead for the first time, she instantly fell head over heels.
To shower the female lead with love and warmth, Shen Qiqi went out of her way to protect her:
* When the female lead was bullied by other vicious cannon fodder, she was the first to help her fight back.
* When the female lead was wronged, she felt heartbroken.
* When the female lead was pursued by a scumbag, she... broke them up!
Meanwhile, Liu Shuang had been reborn with a cold heart, viewing everyone around her as insignificant ants.
Fortunately, she still possessed the magic from her previous life. In this new life, everything remained unchanged except for her once arrogant and overbearing junior sister, who now revolved around her, showering her with flattery and affection.
Using her mind-reading ability, she overheard the junior sister's thoughts:
"OMG, the female lead is so beautiful! I can do this!"
"My senior sister is kind, gentle, and understanding. No one can hurt her!"
"Senior sister, don't be so saintly. You'll be bullied by bad people!"
The Demon Lord Liu Shuang: ??? I'd rather jump off a building than believe Shen Qiqi again! ... My junior sister is so cute, I'm so into her.
A carefree, optimistic, appearance-obsessed salted fish vs. a cold-on-the-outside-but-warm-on-the-inside, beautiful and powerful Demon Lord

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao died tragically.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The man she had saved and cared for for many years despised her and shattered her spirit veins with his own hands and dissolved her body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. I have waited for this day.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan's ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And Ning Yao's lifelong wish is to ascend.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft—those fools don’t know his worth. He’s from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it works, great. If not… well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions. When that happens, their instincts will turn against their beloved, giving rise to an uncontrollable urge to kill.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slay one’s beloved, attain enlightenment, ascend immediately, and forget the past.</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfect outcome for both.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao knew that Feng Jingzhuo had already begun to grow his heart’s scales.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, he endured the agonizing pain, hiding away to claw open his own chest. He ripped out the endlessly growing scales, pinned his own hands down with bone nails—desperately resisting his dragon instincts.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I beg you… whatever you do, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’ll be over soon. Be good. Stay outside…”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside, Ning Yao pondered, if</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we can both ascend, that’s better than neither of us ascending at all.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, she went in.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as she always did, she held him in her arms, kissing his trembling, pale lips with tenderness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After many 10 thousand years, Ning Yao was reborn and successfully ascended.</span>
She forgot Feng Jingzhou, but he remembered her.
Tormenting himself, he wanted to turn back time.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao was very happy, but the ceremony of conferring the gods was a little simple.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the entire world of gods was busy trying to stop a fallen god who wants to activate the forbidden Time-Reversal Array.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Theme: My heart is controlled by me, not by heavens.</span>

In her past life, the empress bestowed upon her a wife, the princess of a fallen kingdom. However, when the crown prince attempted to assault her wife, he was killed in self-defense.
In the end, the fake eunuch and the princess of the fallen kingdom met their fate by being beheaded in public, their lives filled with humiliation and absurdity.

This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.
No! I don't want you to express it with your body either!]]></description>

When she read the part where the villain was forced to marry a manipulative woman during his downfall, Lin Chu couldn’t help but criticize the green tea character.
Who would have expected that she’d black out, only to become that very same troublesome woman who regretted her marriage to the villain on their wedding day and ultimately got herself killed?
Lin Chu: “…”
Stay calm, don’t panic.
Looking at the villainous husband, injured and returning from the battlefield, Lin Chu thought she had found her chance to escape her tragic fate by clinging to his leg for survival…

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!
What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!
With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!
She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”
She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”
She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”
Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”
Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”

      <description><![CDATA[After drinking too much at my retirement celebration, I woke up to find myself inexplicably transformed into a beautiful young boy in another world. In this world where magic reigns supreme, there's a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a 'stud' in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?]]></description>

      <title>The Young Marquis Regrets Too Late</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.
Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.
Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.
Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.
The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…
The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.
That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.
<hr />
Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.
Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.
At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.
He could smile, she realised, but not for her.
From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.
Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.
<hr />
After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.
But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.
On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”
Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”
Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.
For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.]]></description>

However, he was poisoned by an enemy spy on the battlefield, which left him mentally impaired, leading to the tragic downfall of a legendary hero. The Emperor, relieved to have neutralized this formidable threat to his throne, felt a twinge of guilt. Hearing rumors that the "madman" harbored affection for the timid and mute Seventh Prince, Fu Yu'an, the Emperor decided to arrange their marriage, believing it to be a benevolent gesture.  
However, after the wedding, Fu Yu'an, who had to play both father and mother to the seemingly foolish general, was shocked when he saw the "madman" climbing into his bed with clear, calculating eyes. Fu Yu'an kicked him off and exclaimed, "You're not a fool?"  
To which Qi Ren retorted, "And you're not mute, are you? We're both hiding our true selves—so why the disdain?"

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Wen Zhao transmigrated into a low-magic Xianxia novel, only to discover she'd become the cannon fodder second female lead who bullied the female lead, seduced the male lead, and was generally a green tea b*tch, lotus-flower-like antagonist.
In the original novel, she was the catalyst for misunderstandings between the male and female leads, a dedicated tool character who lived until the grand finale. In the end, the male and female leads ended up together, while she suffered the consequences.
To avoid a bad ending, Wen Zhao tried her best to cling to the female lead without being too out of character, hoping to safely exit the story.
Although she was still being required by the system to perform actions befitting a second female lead, Wen Zhao believed the female lead would eventually understand her sincere heart!
However, it seemed like the female lead was looking at her a bit strangely?
••••
Male Lead: A Zhao, I suddenly realized that I might actually like you a little.
Wen Zhao: ???
She thought this was the biggest deviation from the plot, but then the female lead slowly approached.
Lowering her gaze slightly, the female lead, whose gaze was usually cold, revealed a hint of obsession and possessiveness. She walked up to Wen Zhao and smiled softly.
She asked softly, "A Zhao, between him and me, who do you choose?"
Wen Zhao: I choose you! I choose you!
••••
One-Sentence Summary: Thank you everyone, I'm with the female lead now.
Theme: Even when facing difficulties, one should strive to overcome them and have the determination to reverse their situation. Only through hard work can one achieve success. Victory and new surprises are waiting not far away.]]></description>

      <title>Mistakenly Treated The Princess As A Concubine</title>

      <description><![CDATA[After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing'an Marquis's residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle's family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke's residence was snatched away by her stepsister.
After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.
The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.
This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.
The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.
To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.
However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.
When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.
The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.
It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.
She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.
While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.
Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!
————
At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.
At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.
The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.
Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.
And all the girl asked for in return was—
"Sister, kiss me."
"Sister, hug me."
"Sister, cuddle me."
The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.
Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl's "concubine" while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.
————
Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.
Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.
“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”
Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<strong>Lee Su</strong> was trapped in a building on a deserted island.
She had no memories, no recollection of how she got here.
She was rescued by one of the survivors of a plane crash that took place on the island.
<strong>Hayden Wight</strong>. A young gentleman from the United Kingdom. Representative of a security company.
Meeting him could have been a blessing, giving her the chance to escape from vicious criminals.
From his eyes to his lips and his whole body, the man also seemed to want to give her a chance to start a new life.
***
“I don’t know my name or my age. I don’t even know what kinds of danger I am in. That’s why it’s a bit difficult for me to be next to a man.”
Lee Seo expressed concern.
“I mean, you could also be in danger if you were to get involved with me.”
A warm breeze blew in from the sea.
As the sand particles began to fly through the air, Hayden covered Lee Su’s face with his hand and replied,
“Then I’ll have to receive higher compensation. I don’t intend for you to pay me with your body, so you can rest easy.”
Unlike usual, Lee Su could barely control her expression. The memory of last night suddenly came to mind.
His blue eyes focused on Lee Seo.
“Y-you’re staring at me like a filthy beast.” Lee Su stammered, unable to respond properly.
Just then, the question that followed took her breath away.
<em>“Who was it that pretended to be asleep and turned me on?”</em>
She knew he had seen it all last night.

      <description><![CDATA[Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.
After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor's chest: "Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?"
The new emperor kissed her: "You will be fine, just love me."
The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: "Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left."
When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess's obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official's wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.
Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.
------
The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.
Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.
For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, "The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated," before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. Blood poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.
When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.
Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: "Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?"
"... She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore."
Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: "She said she won't fight, so the fight is over?"

      <title>Don't Provoke the Black Lotus O [Transmigration Novel]</title>
      <volume/>
      <chaptername>Chapter 25</chaptername>

      <description><![CDATA[A light-hearted, humorous, face-slapping, satisfying read.
A quirky and clever Alpha × a cold, black lotus Omega.
Jiang Ci transmigrated into the role of a cannon-fodder villain in an ancient ABO novel.
The original body, a prestigious first-rank military marquis with illustrious battle achievements, married the female lead out of lust for her beauty.
After marriage, his true nature was revealed: he imprisoned and abused her, and as a womanizer, he filled his courtyard with concubines, favoring them over his wife... In the end, he was mutilated by the blackened princess, who removed his gland, severed his limbs, and locked him in a pitch-dark dungeon.
When Jiang Ci transmigrated, she found herself straddling the female lead, engaged in unspeakable acts.
Jiang Ci immediately revealed her true self: "I'm not Gao Yi! I won't take the blame for this! I can even prove it by breakdancing!"
Female lead: "???"
The system issued a task: "Please fix the messed-up plot, torment the female lead, and promote her descent into darkness."
Jiang Ci: "No time for you."
System: "???"
…
Jiang Ci had been single for over twenty years and had only ever liked one fictional character.
Now that she had transmigrated into her lord, how could she not seize this heaven-sent opportunity?
No matter who you are, she would confront heaven and earth, and teach a lesson to anyone who bullied the female lead!
After all, she had become the villain—it would be a shame not to act domineering and arrogant!
She gave her all to the female lead, protecting her at every turn, helping her build her career, and imparting all her skills... Only to eventually realize that she was just a substitute, that the female lead had always harbored a white moonlight in her heart.
All the ambiguity between them was because she resembled that person.
Jiang Ci: "Can I know who she is?"
Female lead: "No."
Jiang Ci was finally numb. Heartbroken and disillusioned, she exchanged rewards with the system and returned to her original world.
…
Later, the woman who had ascended to the pinnacle of power got drunk at a palace banquet. "Have you found her?"
Maid: "Your Highness has forgotten, she was a soul transmigrator, not belonging to this world. We don't even know her real name."
The wine cup fell to the ground, and the woman's eyes dimmed.
…
When Jiang Ci woke up again, she found herself still in the novel, but now she had transmigrated into her own body, and ten years had passed.
The young girl she once needed to protect had now become the powerful and influential Grand Princess. It was said that this Grand Princess was cold and aloof, with her only peculiar hobby being to capture those with eccentric personalities and suspected of having delusions.
Jiang Ci wanted nothing to do with the Grand Princess this time and tried her best to keep her identity hidden.
However, the Grand Princess, after ten years, had thoroughly studied all of Jiang Ci's tactics, surpassing her teacher and excelling even further.

      <title>Transmigrating Before The Crazy Beauty Scum A Loses Control</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Summary 1:
"Even if it's a one-for-one trade, I will take over his company."
These were the last words Luan Yenan said before transmigrating into a book.
As the sole head of a Fortune 500 investment company, she never expected her end to be dying from overwork after three sleepless days and nights, only to transmigrate into a novel.
The character she transmigrated into was a crazy, abusive Alpha who tormented the female lead before having her glands removed by the seemingly innocent but secretly cunning female lead.
Crazy? Perfect, I’m crazy too.
Abusive Alpha? Sorry, I’m single and not interested.
As for the female lead, are you talking about the little girl I’ve pinned down, teary-eyed and begging for mercy?
Seemingly innocent but secretly cunning? Interesting.
Let me personally train her. I want to see how she plans to cut out my glands.
Summary 2:
Zuo Baixuan, who had just differentiated into an Omega, was sold by her adoptive parents to a crazy, abusive Alpha. She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.
Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, "I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early."
After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.
One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: "I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce."
Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: "I’ve already graduated."
"So?"
"I want to have a child. With you."
Let’s see who’s really the crazy one.]]></description>

It's a cursed world where he struggles every day. Two months have passed since he set foot in the zombie apocalypse world in his dreams. "Ha...." As soon as he woke up, his gaze was instinctively drawn to the internet broadcast that he habitually left on. -A major riot is occurring in some regions due to the current situation... Then, beep! A loud sound announcing a disaster alert echoed in Junseong's head. Unconsciously picking up his phone along with the alarm sound, Junseong couldn't hide his confused expression.
[10:44 AM] It was the exact time he had always woken up in his dream. Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. "I've been wanting to ask you something."
"What?" As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo's gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. "Why do you look at me like that?" Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. "How am I... looking at you?"
"...." Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the 'fake smile' he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of blood was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of blood from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his 'clothes' but emanated from him.``]]></description>

Han's simple daily life working part-time at a convenience store is suddenly turned upside down.
"Your debt amounts to a total of one hundred million and seven thousand."
With a timid and fearful personality, Han is unwittingly drawn into the world of the 'Tasenda' club to repay the massive debt he incurred. There, he meets Jang Taesin, a man who is a perfect fit for the depths of darkness.
From the moment Taesin laid eyes on Han, he was inexplicably drawn to him and began to obsessively pursue him, offering a proposal to keep him from escaping.
"I'll stay by your side only until I get tired of you. Once I'm tired of your body, I'll consider your debt paid and let you go."
"How long will it take for you to get tired of me?"
"About twenty times, and I won't get tired."
However, instead of getting tired, the thirst only grew stronger.
He wanted to see, touch, and possess him. Once he had his body, he found himself desiring his heart as well.
"Why don't I ever get to see that cheap smile of yours?"
"You'll never see me smile in front of you, even if I die."
Taesin couldn't understand why Han hated him so much, and Han couldn't fathom Taesin's obsession with him.
Thus, the tangled threads of a complex relationship began to weave between the two, as distant from the end of the world as they could be. Can these two people, who seem so far apart from the rest of the world, really be together?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao died tragically.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The man she had saved and cared for for many years despised her and shattered her spirit veins with his own hands and dissolved her body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. I have waited for this day.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan's ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And Ning Yao's lifelong wish is to ascend.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft—those fools don’t know his worth. He’s from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it works, great. If not… well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions. When that happens, their instincts will turn against their beloved, giving rise to an uncontrollable urge to kill.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slay one’s beloved, attain enlightenment, ascend immediately, and forget the past.</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfect outcome for both.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao knew that Feng Jingzhuo had already begun to grow his heart’s scales.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, he endured the agonizing pain, hiding away to claw open his own chest. He ripped out the endlessly growing scales, pinned his own hands down with bone nails—desperately resisting his dragon instincts.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I beg you… whatever you do, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’ll be over soon. Be good. Stay outside…”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside, Ning Yao pondered, if</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we can both ascend, that’s better than neither of us ascending at all.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, she went in.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as she always did, she held him in her arms, kissing his trembling, pale lips with tenderness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After many 10 thousand years, Ning Yao was reborn and successfully ascended.</span>
She forgot Feng Jingzhou, but he remembered her.
Tormenting himself, he wanted to turn back time.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao was very happy, but the ceremony of conferring the gods was a little simple.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the entire world of gods was busy trying to stop a fallen god who wants to activate the forbidden Time-Reversal Array.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Theme: My heart is controlled by me, not by heavens.</span>

The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/wicked-island-of-ireland/chapter-11/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<strong>Lee Su</strong> was trapped in a building on a deserted island.
She had no memories, no recollection of how she got here.
She was rescued by one of the survivors of a plane crash that took place on the island.
<strong>Hayden Wight</strong>. A young gentleman from the United Kingdom. Representative of a security company.
Meeting him could have been a blessing, giving her the chance to escape from vicious criminals.
From his eyes to his lips and his whole body, the man also seemed to want to give her a chance to start a new life.
***
“I don’t know my name or my age. I don’t even know what kinds of danger I am in. That’s why it’s a bit difficult for me to be next to a man.”
Lee Seo expressed concern.
“I mean, you could also be in danger if you were to get involved with me.”
A warm breeze blew in from the sea.
As the sand particles began to fly through the air, Hayden covered Lee Su’s face with his hand and replied,
“Then I’ll have to receive higher compensation. I don’t intend for you to pay me with your body, so you can rest easy.”
Unlike usual, Lee Su could barely control her expression. The memory of last night suddenly came to mind.
His blue eyes focused on Lee Seo.
“Y-you’re staring at me like a filthy beast.” Lee Su stammered, unable to respond properly.
Just then, the question that followed took her breath away.
<em>“Who was it that pretended to be asleep and turned me on?”</em>
She knew he had seen it all last night.

      <title>Transmigrating Before The Crazy Beauty Scum A Loses Control</title>

      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/transmigrating-before-the-crazy-beauty-scum-a-loses-control/chapter-19/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Summary 1:
"Even if it's a one-for-one trade, I will take over his company."
These were the last words Luan Yenan said before transmigrating into a book.
As the sole head of a Fortune 500 investment company, she never expected her end to be dying from overwork after three sleepless days and nights, only to transmigrate into a novel.
The character she transmigrated into was a crazy, abusive Alpha who tormented the female lead before having her glands removed by the seemingly innocent but secretly cunning female lead.
Crazy? Perfect, I’m crazy too.
Abusive Alpha? Sorry, I’m single and not interested.
As for the female lead, are you talking about the little girl I’ve pinned down, teary-eyed and begging for mercy?
Seemingly innocent but secretly cunning? Interesting.
Let me personally train her. I want to see how she plans to cut out my glands.
Summary 2:
Zuo Baixuan, who had just differentiated into an Omega, was sold by her adoptive parents to a crazy, abusive Alpha. She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.
Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, "I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early."
After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.
One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: "I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce."
Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: "I’ve already graduated."
"So?"
"I want to have a child. With you."
Let’s see who’s really the crazy one.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing'an Marquis's residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle's family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke's residence was snatched away by her stepsister.
After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.
The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.
This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.
The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.
To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.
However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.
When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.
The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.
It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.
She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.
While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.
Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!
————
At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.
At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.
The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.
Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.
And all the girl asked for in return was—
"Sister, kiss me."
"Sister, hug me."
"Sister, cuddle me."
The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.
Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl's "concubine" while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.
————
Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.
Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.
“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”
Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The man I had a drunken one-night stand with turned out to be the male lead from the original story. The issue? This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.
No! I don't want you to express it with your body either!]]></description>

      <title>Giving Interstellar Players a Horror Ghost Game Shock</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!
What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!
With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!
She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”
She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”
She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”
Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”
Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”

      <title>The Male Lead's Harem Belongs to Me (GL)</title>

      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/the-male-leads-harem-belongs-to-me-gl/chapter-19-4/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Jiang Han died from staying up too late reading a novel, and after her death, she found herself transported into the ancient melodramatic romance novel she had been reading.
The male lead is a cold and domineering prince, and the female lead is the prince's long-cherished "white moonlight". Unfortunately, the white moonlight has a lowly status, and the prince's mother disapproves. The male lead goes to great lengths, enduring countless melodramatic events, heart-wrenching and physically exhausting, ultimately winning the heart of his beloved and achieving a happy ending. And Jiang Han is one of the cannon fodder female characters who, out of jealousy, targeted the male lead's white moonlight.
Jiang Han, who traveled through time, said: "No way, I just want to be a salted fish and play mahjong every day."
So when the male lead said: "I want to marry my white moonlight."
Jiang Han: Marry! You must marry! The gifts are all ready.
The male lead said: "She is timid and frail. As the princess, you should take good care of her."
Jiang Han: Take care! Must take care of !Tomorrow, I'll have her live next to me!
The male lead said: "She's too considerate. She won't speak up about her needs, so you should be more accommodating to her."
Jiang Han: Move! Must yield! Tomorrow, I will divorce you and give the title of princess to her!
••••
The next day, Jiang Han indeed handed him a divorce letter. The male lead, feeling complicated, signed it, but Jiang Han happily prepared to leave. Just as she reached the gate of the mansion, a group of concubines led by White Moonlight blocked her way.
White Moonlight: Sister Jiang, don't go. Would you stay?
A group of concubines: Yeah, yeah, please don't leave.
Jiang Han showed a troubled expression, and the male lead's heart was filled with joy. Just as he was about to say a few words of persuasion, he saw Jiang Han decisively shake her head.
The male lead thought it was a pity. Before he could catch his breath, he saw the person he held dear, his "white moonlight," take out a divorce agreement and coldly say to him, "Sign it. I want to leave with Sister Jiang."
The male lead stared wide-eyed in disbelief, a mouthful of old blood choked in his chest. However, the next moment, his group of concubines gritted their teeth and said to White Moonlight: "Weiwei, you are being too ungrateful. Why did you prepare the divorce papers all by yourself without telling us?"
#My harem seems to have turned into my princess's, what should I do#
#Is it too late to regret now#
••••
One-on-one [highlight this], before the divorce, they were just pure revolutionary comrades and good friends. After the divorce, there will be romantic developments.]]></description>

These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand. Holding the cannon fodder's script, Sheng Nuan is terrified...

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Li Suimei knew that Qin Qing would disdain to attend her engagement ceremony with Qin Zhan.
After all, as a vicious female supporting character, Li Suimei’s role as a stepping stone for the male and female leads was almost over.
Why would Qin Qing come to help her?
Li Suimei chuckled bitterly. She had heard rumors about Qin Qing being very protective of her loved ones, but she didn't know who had spread those rumors.
——At the engagement ceremony, Qin Qing, who was originally not supposed to attend, suddenly appeared. Wearing a snow-white wedding dress, she stood in the position that should have belonged to the male protagonist and said expressionlessly,
"Now, you are my wife."
Li Suimei: "..."
Didn't this person seem indifferent towards her just yesterday?
••••
Small Theater:
Qin Qing pinched Li Suimei's wrist, her gaze fierce, "Back then, I always thought, you invited me to dinner and movies, stayed up late with me to go through documents, hugged my arm and cried, calling me 'sister.' Whenever I got angry, you would get nervous, and you even walked in and out of my room in your pajamas. If that wasn't love, what was it?"
Li Suimei looked confused, "When did I bent?"
Qin Qing: "..."]]></description>

In this world where magic reigns supreme, there's a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a 'stud' in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?]]></description>

However, he was poisoned by an enemy spy on the battlefield, which left him mentally impaired, leading to the tragic downfall of a legendary hero. The Emperor, relieved to have neutralized this formidable threat to his throne, felt a twinge of guilt. Hearing rumors that the "madman" harbored affection for the timid and mute Seventh Prince, Fu Yu'an, the Emperor decided to arrange their marriage, believing it to be a benevolent gesture.  
However, after the wedding, Fu Yu'an, who had to play both father and mother to the seemingly foolish general, was shocked when he saw the "madman" climbing into his bed with clear, calculating eyes. Fu Yu'an kicked him off and exclaimed, "You're not a fool?"  
To which Qi Ren retorted, "And you're not mute, are you? We're both hiding our true selves—so why the disdain?"

      <description><![CDATA[A light-hearted, humorous, face-slapping, satisfying read.
A quirky and clever Alpha × a cold, black lotus Omega.
Jiang Ci transmigrated into the role of a cannon-fodder villain in an ancient ABO novel.
The original body, a prestigious first-rank military marquis with illustrious battle achievements, married the female lead out of lust for her beauty.
After marriage, his true nature was revealed: he imprisoned and abused her, and as a womanizer, he filled his courtyard with concubines, favoring them over his wife... In the end, he was mutilated by the blackened princess, who removed his gland, severed his limbs, and locked him in a pitch-dark dungeon.
When Jiang Ci transmigrated, she found herself straddling the female lead, engaged in unspeakable acts.
Jiang Ci immediately revealed her true self: "I'm not Gao Yi! I won't take the blame for this! I can even prove it by breakdancing!"
Female lead: "???"
The system issued a task: "Please fix the messed-up plot, torment the female lead, and promote her descent into darkness."
Jiang Ci: "No time for you."
System: "???"
…
Jiang Ci had been single for over twenty years and had only ever liked one fictional character.
Now that she had transmigrated into her lord, how could she not seize this heaven-sent opportunity?
No matter who you are, she would confront heaven and earth, and teach a lesson to anyone who bullied the female lead!
After all, she had become the villain—it would be a shame not to act domineering and arrogant!
She gave her all to the female lead, protecting her at every turn, helping her build her career, and imparting all her skills... Only to eventually realize that she was just a substitute, that the female lead had always harbored a white moonlight in her heart.
All the ambiguity between them was because she resembled that person.
Jiang Ci: "Can I know who she is?"
Female lead: "No."
Jiang Ci was finally numb. Heartbroken and disillusioned, she exchanged rewards with the system and returned to her original world.
…
Later, the woman who had ascended to the pinnacle of power got drunk at a palace banquet. "Have you found her?"
Maid: "Your Highness has forgotten, she was a soul transmigrator, not belonging to this world. We don't even know her real name."
The wine cup fell to the ground, and the woman's eyes dimmed.
…
When Jiang Ci woke up again, she found herself still in the novel, but now she had transmigrated into her own body, and ten years had passed.
The young girl she once needed to protect had now become the powerful and influential Grand Princess. It was said that this Grand Princess was cold and aloof, with her only peculiar hobby being to capture those with eccentric personalities and suspected of having delusions.
Jiang Ci wanted nothing to do with the Grand Princess this time and tried her best to keep her identity hidden.
However, the Grand Princess, after ten years, had thoroughly studied all of Jiang Ci's tactics, surpassing her teacher and excelling even further.

In her past life, the empress bestowed upon her a wife, the princess of a fallen kingdom. However, when the crown prince attempted to assault her wife, he was killed in self-defense.
In the end, the fake eunuch and the princess of the fallen kingdom met their fate by being beheaded in public, their lives filled with humiliation and absurdity.
When Bai Zhi opened her eyes again, she found herself reborn one year earlier, when the beautiful and tragic princess of the fallen kingdom had just been tied up and thrown onto her bed.
This time, she only wanted to survive, but as she tried to leave, she was stopped.
The princess, with teary eyes, clutched her sleeve and asked, "Husband, won’t you take me with you?"
Bai Zhi replied, "From now on, I can only live a hard life of farming. You should find your own way."
Princess: "I am willing to accompany you in a life of men plowing and women weaving."
Bai Zhi: "..." But I am a woman!]]></description>

      <title>After Transmigrating, I and the Female Lead Both Found It 'Really Fragrant' (GL)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Shen Qiqi, a prolific author of female-led novels, was known for her love of torturing the female leads in her stories. She would make the female leads suffer, become isolated, and ultimately turn to the dark side before making a triumphant return.
Never in her wildest dreams did she imagine she would be transported into one of her own novels, turning into a mediocre and vicious cannon fodder—a junior sister who delighted in bullying the female lead and was eventually hung on the city wall as punishment.
To survive, she decided to become a carefree and laid-back player, knowing and daring nothing. However, upon seeing the female lead for the first time, she instantly fell head over heels.
To shower the female lead with love and warmth, Shen Qiqi went out of her way to protect her:
* When the female lead was bullied by other vicious cannon fodder, she was the first to help her fight back.
* When the female lead was wronged, she felt heartbroken.
* When the female lead was pursued by a scumbag, she... broke them up!
Meanwhile, Liu Shuang had been reborn with a cold heart, viewing everyone around her as insignificant ants.
Fortunately, she still possessed the magic from her previous life. In this new life, everything remained unchanged except for her once arrogant and overbearing junior sister, who now revolved around her, showering her with flattery and affection.
Using her mind-reading ability, she overheard the junior sister's thoughts:
"OMG, the female lead is so beautiful! I can do this!"
"My senior sister is kind, gentle, and understanding. No one can hurt her!"
"Senior sister, don't be so saintly. You'll be bullied by bad people!"
The Demon Lord Liu Shuang: ??? I'd rather jump off a building than believe Shen Qiqi again! ... My junior sister is so cute, I'm so into her.
A carefree, optimistic, appearance-obsessed salted fish vs. a cold-on-the-outside-but-warm-on-the-inside, beautiful and powerful Demon Lord
1v1 HE, light-hearted and sweet]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao died tragically.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The man she had saved and cared for for many years despised her and shattered her spirit veins with his own hands and dissolved her body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. I have waited for this day.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan's ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And Ning Yao's lifelong wish is to ascend.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft—those fools don’t know his worth. He’s from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it works, great. If not… well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions. When that happens, their instincts will turn against their beloved, giving rise to an uncontrollable urge to kill.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slay one’s beloved, attain enlightenment, ascend immediately, and forget the past.</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfect outcome for both.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao knew that Feng Jingzhuo had already begun to grow his heart’s scales.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, he endured the agonizing pain, hiding away to claw open his own chest. He ripped out the endlessly growing scales, pinned his own hands down with bone nails—desperately resisting his dragon instincts.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I beg you… whatever you do, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’ll be over soon. Be good. Stay outside…”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside, Ning Yao pondered, if</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we can both ascend, that’s better than neither of us ascending at all.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, she went in.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as she always did, she held him in her arms, kissing his trembling, pale lips with tenderness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After many 10 thousand years, Ning Yao was reborn and successfully ascended.</span>
She forgot Feng Jingzhou, but he remembered her.
Tormenting himself, he wanted to turn back time.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao was very happy, but the ceremony of conferring the gods was a little simple.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the entire world of gods was busy trying to stop a fallen god who wants to activate the forbidden Time-Reversal Array.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Theme: My heart is controlled by me, not by heavens.</span>

Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."

The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

      <description><![CDATA[Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.
After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor's chest: "Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?"
The new emperor kissed her: "You will be fine, just love me."
The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: "Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left."
When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess's obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official's wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.
Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.
------
The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.
Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.
For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, "The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated," before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. Blood poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.
When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.
Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: "Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?"
"... She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore."
Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: "She said she won't fight, so the fight is over?"

      <description><![CDATA[Lin Chu, an engineering student, was following a novel and found the villain character especially compelling. When she read the part where the villain was forced to marry a manipulative woman during his downfall, Lin Chu couldn’t help but criticize the green tea character.
Who would have expected that she’d black out, only to become that very same troublesome woman who regretted her marriage to the villain on their wedding day and ultimately got herself killed?
Lin Chu: “…”
Stay calm, don’t panic.
Looking at the villainous husband, injured and returning from the battlefield, Lin Chu thought she had found her chance to escape her tragic fate by clinging to his leg for survival…

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!
What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!
With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!
She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”
She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”
She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”
Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”
Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”

      <description><![CDATA[The man I had a drunken one-night stand with turned out to be the male lead from the original story. The issue? This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.
No! I don't want you to express it with your body either!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.
Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.
Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.
Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.
The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…
The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.
That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.
<hr />
Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.
Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.
At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.
He could smile, she realised, but not for her.
From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.
Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.
<hr />
After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.
But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.
On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”
Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”
Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.
For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.]]></description>

However, he was poisoned by an enemy spy on the battlefield, which left him mentally impaired, leading to the tragic downfall of a legendary hero. The Emperor, relieved to have neutralized this formidable threat to his throne, felt a twinge of guilt. Hearing rumors that the "madman" harbored affection for the timid and mute Seventh Prince, Fu Yu'an, the Emperor decided to arrange their marriage, believing it to be a benevolent gesture.  
However, after the wedding, Fu Yu'an, who had to play both father and mother to the seemingly foolish general, was shocked when he saw the "madman" climbing into his bed with clear, calculating eyes. Fu Yu'an kicked him off and exclaimed, "You're not a fool?"  
To which Qi Ren retorted, "And you're not mute, are you? We're both hiding our true selves—so why the disdain?"

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Wen Zhao transmigrated into a low-magic Xianxia novel, only to discover she'd become the cannon fodder second female lead who bullied the female lead, seduced the male lead, and was generally a green tea b*tch, lotus-flower-like antagonist.
In the original novel, she was the catalyst for misunderstandings between the male and female leads, a dedicated tool character who lived until the grand finale. In the end, the male and female leads ended up together, while she suffered the consequences.
To avoid a bad ending, Wen Zhao tried her best to cling to the female lead without being too out of character, hoping to safely exit the story.
Although she was still being required by the system to perform actions befitting a second female lead, Wen Zhao believed the female lead would eventually understand her sincere heart!
However, it seemed like the female lead was looking at her a bit strangely?
••••
Male Lead: A Zhao, I suddenly realized that I might actually like you a little.
Wen Zhao: ???
She thought this was the biggest deviation from the plot, but then the female lead slowly approached.
Lowering her gaze slightly, the female lead, whose gaze was usually cold, revealed a hint of obsession and possessiveness. She walked up to Wen Zhao and smiled softly.
She asked softly, "A Zhao, between him and me, who do you choose?"
Wen Zhao: I choose you! I choose you!
••••
One-Sentence Summary: Thank you everyone, I'm with the female lead now.
Theme: Even when facing difficulties, one should strive to overcome them and have the determination to reverse their situation. Only through hard work can one achieve success. Victory and new surprises are waiting not far away.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[To survive, Sheng Nuan must traverse different worlds, playing the role of self-destructive cannon fodder while saving the darkest villains. These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand. Holding the cannon fodder's script, Sheng Nuan is terrified...
Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

      <title>Mistakenly Treated The Princess As A Concubine</title>

      <description><![CDATA[After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing'an Marquis's residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle's family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke's residence was snatched away by her stepsister.
After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.
The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.
This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.
The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.
To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.
However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.
When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.
The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.
It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.
She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.
While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.
Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!
————
At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.
At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.
The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.
Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.
And all the girl asked for in return was—
"Sister, kiss me."
"Sister, hug me."
"Sister, cuddle me."
The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.
Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl's "concubine" while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.
————
Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.
Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.
“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”
Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<strong>Lee Su</strong> was trapped in a building on a deserted island.
She had no memories, no recollection of how she got here.
She was rescued by one of the survivors of a plane crash that took place on the island.
<strong>Hayden Wight</strong>. A young gentleman from the United Kingdom. Representative of a security company.
Meeting him could have been a blessing, giving her the chance to escape from vicious criminals.
From his eyes to his lips and his whole body, the man also seemed to want to give her a chance to start a new life.
***
“I don’t know my name or my age. I don’t even know what kinds of danger I am in. That’s why it’s a bit difficult for me to be next to a man.”
Lee Seo expressed concern.
“I mean, you could also be in danger if you were to get involved with me.”
A warm breeze blew in from the sea.
As the sand particles began to fly through the air, Hayden covered Lee Su’s face with his hand and replied,
“Then I’ll have to receive higher compensation. I don’t intend for you to pay me with your body, so you can rest easy.”
Unlike usual, Lee Su could barely control her expression. The memory of last night suddenly came to mind.
His blue eyes focused on Lee Seo.
“Y-you’re staring at me like a filthy beast.” Lee Su stammered, unable to respond properly.
Just then, the question that followed took her breath away.
<em>“Who was it that pretended to be asleep and turned me on?”</em>
She knew he had seen it all last night.

If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.
Who knew he’d be reborn again…
When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky. Just what are you playing at!?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[To survive, Sheng Nuan must traverse different worlds, playing the role of self-destructive cannon fodder while saving the darkest villains. These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand. Holding the cannon fodder's script, Sheng Nuan is terrified...
Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...
