      <description><![CDATA[Gu Yu Qi, a daughter born to a marquis household. She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky. It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.
But what happened to her in the end?
For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.
If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.
Who knew he’d be reborn again…
When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky. Just what are you playing at!?]]></description>

These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand.

Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

      <title>Transmigrating Before The Crazy Beauty Scum A Loses Control</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Summary 1:
"Even if it's a one-for-one trade, I will take over his company."
These were the last words Luan Yenan said before transmigrating into a book.
As the sole head of a Fortune 500 investment company, she never expected her end to be dying from overwork after three sleepless days and nights, only to transmigrate into a novel.
The character she transmigrated into was a crazy, abusive Alpha who tormented the female lead before having her glands removed by the seemingly innocent but secretly cunning female lead.
Crazy? Perfect, I’m crazy too.
Abusive Alpha? Sorry, I’m single and not interested.
As for the female lead, are you talking about the little girl I’ve pinned down, teary-eyed and begging for mercy?
Seemingly innocent but secretly cunning? Interesting.
Let me personally train her. I want to see how she plans to cut out my glands.
Summary 2:
Zuo Baixuan, who had just differentiated into an Omega, was sold by her adoptive parents to a crazy, abusive Alpha. She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.
Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, "I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early."
After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.
One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: "I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce."
Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: "I’ve already graduated."
"So?"
"I want to have a child. With you."
Let’s see who’s really the crazy one.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In the book, she is a useless person from a poor family. Because she is easy to control, Lu Zijin chooses her to be the redundant Alpha of the Lu family.
Originally, she could have just enjoyed the easy life provided, but she gradually became greedy. She not only covets the Lu family’s wealth but also wants to make the female lead, Lu Zijin, submit to her. She tries to harm Lu Zijin several times, but each attempt is exposed. In the end, Lu Zijin and her childhood friend break both of Wei Lan’s legs and throw her out of the Lu family.
A few days later, she dies.
Wei Lan frowns as she looks at the original book’s content: Is the easy life not good enough, or is jade not worth carving? Why would you go and provoke the female lead for no reason?
Learning her lesson, Wei Lan strictly follows the rules Lu Zijin sets for her, never crossing the line or actively seeking Lu Zijin’s attention. She rarely goes out, always holding a few unremarkable stones that she carves.
At first, Lu Zijin finds this redundant Alpha well-behaved. She only allows Wei Lan to share her bed during the heat period and sends her away afterward. Wei Lan never complains.
But gradually, Lu Zijin feels differently about this redundant Alpha. Even after the heat period, she enjoys being around Wei Lan. However, Wei Lan always declines because of the few rough stones she carries, making Lu Zijin dislike those stones.
Over the past year, the most popular jade carver in the Great Zhou Dynasty is Qing Lan. This carver is extremely mysterious, rarely appearing in public. Even when she does, she wears a mask and a wide black hooded cloak, hiding her face.
Her carvings are highly sought after and fetch high prices.
One evening, the so-called redundant Alpha who lives off others returns. Wei Lan holds a stack of silver notes, her eyes sparkling as she looks at Lu Zijin: “Wife, I sold my carved ornaments for a good price again.”
Lu Zijin looks at Wei Lan with gentle eyes: “Good job, very obedient. There’ll be a reward later.”

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Qing wakes up to find herself transported into an ancient famine novel, becoming a shameless rogue. During a famine, the original host scams food and drink in the city, committing all sorts of evil deeds. With an innocent and harmless face, she tricks the distressed Jiang Jinhuang into marrying her. After the marriage, the original host’s true nature is revealed. When Jiang Jinhuang refuses to consummate the marriage, the host relentlessly pressures and torments her, even nearly strangling Jiang Jinhuang’s younger sister to death. After enduring countless hardships, Jiang Jinhuang finally returns to the capital, where her family and childhood friend deal with the original host, whose final destination is a mass grave outside the city.
Ye Qing, having received the entire plot, plans to stay far away from Jiang Jinhuang and live well in this ancient world. But just as she prepares to leave, her personal system activates, unlocking the spatial ability from her previous life. Unlike before, her space now includes land and a spiritual spring. The system tells her that by earning Jiang Jinhuang’s favor, she can gain rewards to ensure she won’t starve during the famine.
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 potato seeds;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with a 2-pound carp;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 eggs…
Through her efforts, Ye Qing helps Jiang Jinhuang and her sister thrive during the famine. When she successfully escorts Jiang Jinhuang back to the capital and prepares to leave alone, Jiang Jinhuang’s eyes redden with tears.
Jiang Jinhuang, the daughter of the Minister of Rites, is separated from her family during a visit to Linzhou when they are scattered by rioters. After many struggles, she reaches Linzhou but fails to find her relatives. Lost and desperate, she believes Ye Qing’s words and temporarily marries her. However, after the marriage, Ye Qing becomes a different person, constantly abusing her. Then, one day, Ye Qing suddenly changes for the better, protecting Jiang Jinhuang and her sister, ensuring they never go hungry. Later, Ye Qing even escorts them back to the capital. When Ye Qing tries to leave, Jiang Jinhuang blocks the door, her fox-like eyes staring at Ye Qing with an unreadable expression, saying, “Where do you think you’re going, abandoning me?”

      <description><![CDATA["Every day, a recurring hellish dream. Junseong is stuck in a world that feels like an endless loop, much like a roguelike game. It's a cursed world where he struggles every day. Two months have passed since he set foot in the zombie apocalypse world in his dreams. "Ha...." As soon as he woke up, his gaze was instinctively drawn to the internet broadcast that he habitually left on. -A major riot is occurring in some regions due to the current situation... Then, beep! A loud sound announcing a disaster alert echoed in Junseong's head. Unconsciously picking up his phone along with the alarm sound, Junseong couldn't hide his confused expression.
[10:44 AM] It was the exact time he had always woken up in his dream. Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. "I've been wanting to ask you something."
"What?" As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo's gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. "Why do you look at me like that?" Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. "How am I... looking at you?"
"...." Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the 'fake smile' he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of blood was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of blood from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his 'clothes' but emanated from him.``]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[When Yu Jing was 19 years old, she still hadn’t differentiated, but it didn’t affect her image as a beautiful and strong Alpha in the eyes of her fans.
Three years after her debut, she won over a huge group of loyal fans while somehow gaining an enemy—actress Ming Zhu, known as the queen of ratings.
Ming Zhu was an Alpha; sheclashed with Yu Jing at an event, and Yu Jing thought they’d never cross paths again. But, by some twist of fate, they were invited to the same reality show.
Before filming even started, their fans were already tearing each other apart on Weibo.
Yu Jing couldn’t resist checking the comments and got angrier the more she read.
She could accept being called a has-been, and she could tolerate accusations of riding Ming Zhu’s fame. But someone dared question her gender, saying she’d definitely differentiate as an Omega???
Yu Jing suppressed the urge to jump into the fray, secretly swearing: Once I differentiate into a top-tier Alpha, I’ll crush all you haters and your idol into the ground!
Then she differentiated into a delicate Omega.
And got pinned against the wall by Ming Zhu.
In an intimate room—
Ming Zhu’s fingers brushed over the fragile skin hiding her gland, looking down at the person in her arms, her tone soft: “Are you okay?”
Yu Jing’s hands weakly clung to her neck, her cheeks flushed, her voice soft and pleading:
“Mark me already, please.”
<hr />
<strong>Warnings:</strong>
1. Lots of original world-building, Alphas don’t have male anatomy.
2. Melodramatic plot, slow-burn romance, proceed with caution if it’s not your thing.

      <description><![CDATA[What made Jiang Chuxie collapse even more than transmigrating into a blood-type novel was that she became the scumbag Alpha dad of the book’s female lead… or rather, mom?
The scumbag Alpha mom relied on the female lead’s mother, Gu Lingjun, to rise to wealth and prominence. She teamed up with her mistress to kill the original wife and seize the family fortune that should have belonged to the female lead, setting the stage for the female lead’s tragic life.
As for the ending, this scumbag Alpha naturally didn’t fare well either. She was ultimately ruined by her daughter’s six Alphas, left with a shattered family and no place to be buried.
Jiang Chuxie had no desire to follow in the original body’s footsteps. She didn’t want to be a scumbag, nor did she want to be killed. She just wanted to live peacefully… Wait, why does the person sleeping beside her look so much like… Gu Lingjun?
Jiang Chuxie couldn’t escape the fate of an ABO novel. Forced to marry due to pregnancy and reluctantly accepting her fate, the gentle Omega, who had always been submissive, suddenly changed drastically. She broke up, threw money at her, and ran off pregnant, turning the tables and making Jiang Chuxie the one who got played.
Jiang Chuxie: Wait, isn’t something off with this plot?
Gu Lingjun: If it’s off, that’s just right.

Using Seokju's insomnia as an excuse, Ajin fell asleep in his embrace, becoming accustomed to his body temperature. "I want to work at your place until I die." "Then just stay here. Here, in my room, sit on my knees. Let me bring the world to this room. But doubts keep sprouting, despite sealing the cracks of happiness."
"Ajin, you can't leave this room until you've paid off all your debts." Now, this room became Ajin's world, yet he found solace in the fact that Seokju didn't abandon him.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[A light-hearted, humorous, face-slapping, satisfying read.
A quirky and clever Alpha × a cold, black lotus Omega.
Jiang Ci transmigrated into the role of a cannon-fodder villain in an ancient ABO novel.
The original body, a prestigious first-rank military marquis with illustrious battle achievements, married the female lead out of lust for her beauty.
After marriage, his true nature was revealed: he imprisoned and abused her, and as a womanizer, he filled his courtyard with concubines, favoring them over his wife... In the end, he was mutilated by the blackened princess, who removed his gland, severed his limbs, and locked him in a pitch-dark dungeon.
When Jiang Ci transmigrated, she found herself straddling the female lead, engaged in unspeakable acts.
Jiang Ci immediately revealed her true self: "I'm not Gao Yi! I won't take the blame for this! I can even prove it by breakdancing!"
Female lead: "???"
The system issued a task: "Please fix the messed-up plot, torment the female lead, and promote her descent into darkness."
Jiang Ci: "No time for you."
System: "???"
…
Jiang Ci had been single for over twenty years and had only ever liked one fictional character.
Now that she had transmigrated into her lord, how could she not seize this heaven-sent opportunity?
No matter who you are, she would confront heaven and earth, and teach a lesson to anyone who bullied the female lead!
After all, she had become the villain—it would be a shame not to act domineering and arrogant!
She gave her all to the female lead, protecting her at every turn, helping her build her career, and imparting all her skills... Only to eventually realize that she was just a substitute, that the female lead had always harbored a white moonlight in her heart.
All the ambiguity between them was because she resembled that person.
Jiang Ci: "Can I know who she is?"
Female lead: "No."
Jiang Ci was finally numb. Heartbroken and disillusioned, she exchanged rewards with the system and returned to her original world.
…
Later, the woman who had ascended to the pinnacle of power got drunk at a palace banquet. "Have you found her?"
Maid: "Your Highness has forgotten, she was a soul transmigrator, not belonging to this world. We don't even know her real name."
The wine cup fell to the ground, and the woman's eyes dimmed.
…
When Jiang Ci woke up again, she found herself still in the novel, but now she had transmigrated into her own body, and ten years had passed.
The young girl she once needed to protect had now become the powerful and influential Grand Princess. It was said that this Grand Princess was cold and aloof, with her only peculiar hobby being to capture those with eccentric personalities and suspected of having delusions.
Jiang Ci wanted nothing to do with the Grand Princess this time and tried her best to keep her identity hidden.
However, the Grand Princess, after ten years, had thoroughly studied all of Jiang Ci's tactics, surpassing her teacher and excelling even further.

"...Ah, I got it right this time? Yeah, I'll use this for my fiancé. What of it?" Ian's voice continued soothingly. "Even if I just torment him a little, that young master will run off crying to his daddy. If he's an alpha, he might even be traumatized."
In this world, is this a dream or reality? Is my fiancé now buying adult toys from my favorite club just to torment me? That sounded far more alluring and sweet than any love confession Noah had ever heard. Noah immediately changed the resolve he had just made to not marry Ian Miller. Someone who would even pluck a star from the sky for him is nothing special, and someone who hates him is nothing special either, but someone who will torment him is most welcome. This marriage must happen! It absolutely must! The delusion and love between a lovable, cute masochist and a lone, serious bad guy!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Shen Hanzhi woke up and found herself transmigrated into a novel as the villainous Alpha with the same name. The original Shen Hanzhi forced Wen Jin, a pitiful female protagonist from a fallen family, to marry her. She plundered Wen Jin’s possessions, forcibly marked her, and, after growing bored, brought a lover home to provoke the already pregnant Wen Jin.
Wen Jin lost her child and was imprisoned by Shen Hanzhi in a villa; she was completely blackened. Later, with the help of the male protagonist Liang Shuo, Wen Jin escaped the Shen family and ruined Shen Hanzhi’s reputation, leaving her as a madwoman on the streets.
Shen Hanzhi received the original novel’s plot. When she regained her senses, she was putting a wedding ring on Wen Jin’s finger. She turned to flee the wedding scene, but before she could move, her central nervous system received a shock.
Along with the shock, a strange voice echoed in her mind: The host cannot act out of character, or the villainous Alpha system will judge it as immediate death. At this, Shen Hanzhi felt completely numb!
Thus, Shen Hanzhi and Wen Jin’s daily life became like this:
Shen Hanzhi glared fiercely at Wen Jin: “You wrote my name so uglily, so you must write it ten more times as punishment!”
Shen Hanzhi stared at the delicate girl on the bed with a harsh tone: “I told you eight hundred times to eat more green peppers for nutrition, but you picked them out again!”
Wen Jin lived in a quagmire. She was an illegitimate daughter treated as a shame by the Wen family, living worse than a dog. Before leaving the Wen family at nineteen, she couldn’t even read.
A woman named Shen Hanzhi taught her to read, took her to various places to have fun, and gave her the life a person should have. Her Sister Shen was perfect in every way, except her tone sometimes sounded fierce.
But when Wen Jin watched TV, she understood it was the flirtation between wives, so she wasn’t afraid. When Wen Jin turned twenty, Shen Hanzhi finally accumulated enough villainous Alpha points to divorce the girl and live her own life.
But the girl hugged her neck and coquettishly said: “Sister, I like it when you bully me.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[After drinking too much at my retirement celebration, I woke up to find myself inexplicably transformed into a beautiful young boy in another world. In this world where magic reigns supreme, there's a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a 'stud' in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Yu Heyi received a wedding invitation from the Omega she had secretly loved for years, she was lying in a hospital bed.
She got into a car accident during a race and had to retire.
Under the double blow, Yu Heyi accepted her mom’s suggestion.
Going on a blind date.
Her mom praised the other person like crazy, saying they were a perfect Omega, beautiful and soft and gentle.
Then…
She found out the blind date was her most hated person, no one else came close!
Her love rival—Chi Ruixi.
She still hadn’t figured out how her beta love rival turned into an Omega.
And on the day of the blind date, she marked her.
It was Chi Ruixi, crying and begging her to mark her…
Afterward, Yu Heyi said three things.
“I’ll take responsibility, I’ll fulfill an Alpha’s duties.”
“I’ll treat you well, I’ll be considerate.”
“But don’t expect love.”
Chi Ruixi heard this, gave a slight smile, and said, “No need.”
Jobless Yu Heyi was arranged by her mom to work as a chef in the cafeteria of XX Middle School.
She found out the gentle and delicate literature teacher was—Chi Ruixi?
But Chi Ruixi’s cold words made her feel weird, a bit uncomfortable.
Yu Heyi thought it was pheromones that drew her to Chi Ruixi, otherwise why would she find
Chi Ruixi, the bridesmaid at the wedding, way more charming than the bride she’d loved for years.
Then, in a daze, she permanently marked Chi Ruixi.
Chi Ruixi kept waiting for that dumb Alpha to admit she loved her, but her dumb Alpha was truly dumb.

      <description><![CDATA[Zhou Yining died suddenly after 17 hours of intense work. When she woke up, she found herself transported into a romance novel, becoming the self-conscious and sensitive female lead.
The original character was a student at Nanchuan City No. 1 High School with average grades but secretly in love with the male lead, Zhang Ye. This caused the female supporting characters in the book to viciously slander her and even bully her at school. Among them, the one who hated the original character the most was the wealthy heiress Jiang Xianzhi.
After enduring persecution from her family, a series of school bullying incidents, and a physically and emotionally abusive relationship with the male lead, the original character finally achieved a happy ending with him.
Thinking about the original plot, Zhou Yining almost laughed in anger. That shitty male lead?
She didn’t care for him at all. It was her senior year, and clearly, the teachers hadn’t assigned enough homework if there was still time for this useless romantic nonsense.
Zhou Yining tore the original plot apart. She studied hard, aiming to top every subject. She rejected her family’s moral manipulation, gathered evidence to send those who bullied the original character to justice, and kicked the male lead, who loved to act cool for no reason, to the curb.
As she fought her way forward, she realized that the rich girl who used to hate her was actually kind of cute. When she got close, the rich girl would even blush?
Jiang Xianzhi realized she didn’t hate Zhou Yining anymore. Ever since Zhou Yining came back from being sick, she’d been acting strange. She wasn’t afraid of Jiang Xianzhi anymore and sometimes said weird things that made Jiang Xianzhi’s face turn red.
So Jiang Xianzhi’s daily life became:
September 2: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 3: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 4: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red…
September 13: After more than ten days of defeat, the rich girl decided to stand up for herself!
But on September 14, she was still teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red!

      <description><![CDATA[Summary 1:
"Even if it's a one-for-one trade, I will take over his company."
These were the last words Luan Yenan said before transmigrating into a book.
As the sole head of a Fortune 500 investment company, she never expected her end to be dying from overwork after three sleepless days and nights, only to transmigrate into a novel.
The character she transmigrated into was a crazy, abusive Alpha who tormented the female lead before having her glands removed by the seemingly innocent but secretly cunning female lead.
Crazy? Perfect, I’m crazy too.
Abusive Alpha? Sorry, I’m single and not interested.
As for the female lead, are you talking about the little girl I’ve pinned down, teary-eyed and begging for mercy?
Seemingly innocent but secretly cunning? Interesting.
Let me personally train her. I want to see how she plans to cut out my glands.
Summary 2:
Zuo Baixuan, who had just differentiated into an Omega, was sold by her adoptive parents to a crazy, abusive Alpha. She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.
Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, "I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early."
After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.
One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: "I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce."
Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: "I’ve already graduated."
"So?"
"I want to have a child. With you."
Let’s see who’s really the crazy one.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[If Shu Yue did not say it, very few people would realize that she was an Alpha.
She dressed plainly, always wore old-fashioned black-rimmed glasses on the bridge of her nose, and spoke and acted rigidly like a robot.
No one knew either that she and Meng Zhiyu, the most popular butterfly-like Omega in the art department, were a couple.
Meng Zhiyu pursued her. The two secretly dated from high school until now, and no one ever found out.
One day, Shu Yue was dumped by Meng Zhiyu.
Also on that day, Shu Yue picked up a cat in the pouring rain.
When a cold and mature great beauty came knocking, Shu Yue then realized that it was the spiritual body of the top-class Omega Ji Shiyi.
A little cat that always ignored others but acted sweet only in her palm.
And the first thing Ji Shiyi said to Shu Yue was, “Hello, I know this is abrupt, but could you please mark me?”
Heartbroken Shu Yue decided to help others for good.
But she really did not expect that the person she helped was the ex-aunt of her ex-girlfriend who was now trying to get back together with her, the head of the Ji family, and her research project’s boss.
Shu Yue: “…………”
Looking at the scene in front of her that had turned into a complete mess, Shu Yue only wanted to say—
Hello, is it still possible to undo a mark now?
*1v1, seven-year age gap, happy ending with the aunt, likely bittersweet and sweet.
*ABO setting
*The aunt’s spiritual body is actually a snow leopard beauty!

      <description><![CDATA[After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing'an Marquis's residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle's family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke's residence was snatched away by her stepsister.
After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.
The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.
This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.
The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.
To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.
However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.
When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.
The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.
It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.
She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.
While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.
Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!
————
At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.
At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.
The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.
Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.
And all the girl asked for in return was—
"Sister, kiss me."
"Sister, hug me."
"Sister, cuddle me."
The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.
Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl's "concubine" while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.
————
Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.
Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.
“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”
Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—]]></description>

      <title>After the Top Idol Omega and I Started Living Together</title>
      <volume/>
      <chaptername>Chapter 9</chaptername>
      <nameextend/>
      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/after-the-top-idol-omega-and-i-started-living-together/chapter-9/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Summary One:
The unshakable number one idol of the music world, Jing Yuan, had never shown her face once in twelve years since her debut. The year she announced her retirement was also the year Lu Zhao began to shine.
On the day Lu Zhao won Best Singer of the Year, the media couldn't wait to crown her as the "New Number One Idol in Music." The topic trended for three days straight, and the two fanbases fought endlessly online.
Not long after, the official announcement stated that Jing Yuan would return and make a public appearance. Everyone speculated that Lu Zhao, from the same company, had threatened her position.
On the day of the live-streamed press conference, Jing Yuan made her first appearance with black hair and a red dress, stunning and seductive.
Just as people were marveling at her beauty, a bold reporter asked, "Ms. Jing Yuan, do you have anything to say to your junior colleague Lu Zhao?"
Jing Yuan smiled meaningfully, paused for a few seconds, then said, "I hope she comes home on time tonight."
Right after those words, the livestream lagged and the internet exploded. Tags like #JingYuanSuspectedToBeDatingLuZhao and #JingYuan+LuZhao shot to the top of the trending list.
No one knew the top idol Jing Yuan’s real name was Sheng Jingyu.
No one knew her gland was congenitally underdeveloped, and she couldn’t smell any Alpha pheromones.
Even fewer knew that Lu Zhao was the only Alpha whose scent Sheng Jingyu could perceive.
Summary Two:
The first time Lu Zhao met Sheng Jingyu, she was drinking alone in a booth for two.
With black hair over her shoulders and a thin dress hanging off them, she looked strikingly unique in the decadent bar.
She was completely drunk. Clearly, she had only retired from her idol career, yet she looked like a pitiful, abandoned drunk Alpha, even pulling off her own inhibitor patch.
The second time Lu Zhao saw her, she was sitting in the garden of an old house, using sign language to explain that she was her co-renting roommate.
Only then did Lu Zhao realize that the beautiful Omega she once called boring couldn't speak.
Sheng Jingyu claimed she had been a musician before losing her voice, so Lu Zhao often asked her for guidance.
Under her mentorship, Lu Zhao improved rapidly, but she always felt something was off.
Were they standing too close?
Did her hand really need to stay on her own lower abdomen?
If she moved higher, wouldn’t she be touching her gland?!
…
Before Lu Zhao could figure anything out, Sheng Jingyu’s inhibitors stopped working due to her gland issue.
In a room filled with the weak scent of green grape and absinthe, Lu Zhao was guided into giving her first-ever temporary mark.
Later, Lu Zhao found the notebook Sheng Jingyu used to communicate before learning sign language.
She realized the handwriting was identical to the autographed copy she had collected from a Jing Yuan fan special.]]></description>

      <title>After Transmigrating, I and the Female Lead Both Found It 'Really Fragrant' (GL)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Shen Qiqi, a prolific author of female-led novels, was known for her love of torturing the female leads in her stories. She would make the female leads suffer, become isolated, and ultimately turn to the dark side before making a triumphant return.
Never in her wildest dreams did she imagine she would be transported into one of her own novels, turning into a mediocre and vicious cannon fodder—a junior sister who delighted in bullying the female lead and was eventually hung on the city wall as punishment.
To survive, she decided to become a carefree and laid-back player, knowing and daring nothing. However, upon seeing the female lead for the first time, she instantly fell head over heels.
To shower the female lead with love and warmth, Shen Qiqi went out of her way to protect her:
* When the female lead was bullied by other vicious cannon fodder, she was the first to help her fight back.
* When the female lead was wronged, she felt heartbroken.
* When the female lead was pursued by a scumbag, she... broke them up!
Meanwhile, Liu Shuang had been reborn with a cold heart, viewing everyone around her as insignificant ants.
Fortunately, she still possessed the magic from her previous life. In this new life, everything remained unchanged except for her once arrogant and overbearing junior sister, who now revolved around her, showering her with flattery and affection.
Using her mind-reading ability, she overheard the junior sister's thoughts:
"OMG, the female lead is so beautiful! I can do this!"
"My senior sister is kind, gentle, and understanding. No one can hurt her!"
"Senior sister, don't be so saintly. You'll be bullied by bad people!"
The Demon Lord Liu Shuang: ??? I'd rather jump off a building than believe Shen Qiqi again! ... My junior sister is so cute, I'm so into her.
A carefree, optimistic, appearance-obsessed salted fish vs. a cold-on-the-outside-but-warm-on-the-inside, beautiful and powerful Demon Lord
1v1 HE, light-hearted and sweet]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Jiang Han died from staying up too late reading a novel, and after her death, she found herself transported into the ancient melodramatic romance novel she had been reading.
The male lead is a cold and domineering prince, and the female lead is the prince's long-cherished "white moonlight". Unfortunately, the white moonlight has a lowly status, and the prince's mother disapproves. The male lead goes to great lengths, enduring countless melodramatic events, heart-wrenching and physically exhausting, ultimately winning the heart of his beloved and achieving a happy ending. And Jiang Han is one of the cannon fodder female characters who, out of jealousy, targeted the male lead's white moonlight.
Jiang Han, who traveled through time, said: "No way, I just want to be a salted fish and play mahjong every day."
So when the male lead said: "I want to marry my white moonlight."
Jiang Han: Marry! You must marry! The gifts are all ready.
The male lead said: "She is timid and frail. As the princess, you should take good care of her."
Jiang Han: Take care! Must take care of !Tomorrow, I'll have her live next to me!
The male lead said: "She's too considerate. She won't speak up about her needs, so you should be more accommodating to her."
Jiang Han: Move! Must yield! Tomorrow, I will divorce you and give the title of princess to her!
••••
The next day, Jiang Han indeed handed him a divorce letter. The male lead, feeling complicated, signed it, but Jiang Han happily prepared to leave. Just as she reached the gate of the mansion, a group of concubines led by White Moonlight blocked her way.
White Moonlight: Sister Jiang, don't go. Would you stay?
A group of concubines: Yeah, yeah, please don't leave.
Jiang Han showed a troubled expression, and the male lead's heart was filled with joy. Just as he was about to say a few words of persuasion, he saw Jiang Han decisively shake her head.
The male lead thought it was a pity. Before he could catch his breath, he saw the person he held dear, his "white moonlight," take out a divorce agreement and coldly say to him, "Sign it. I want to leave with Sister Jiang."
The male lead stared wide-eyed in disbelief, a mouthful of old blood choked in his chest. However, the next moment, his group of concubines gritted their teeth and said to White Moonlight: "Weiwei, you are being too ungrateful. Why did you prepare the divorce papers all by yourself without telling us?"
#My harem seems to have turned into my princess's, what should I do#
#Is it too late to regret now#
••••
One-on-one [highlight this], before the divorce, they were just pure revolutionary comrades and good friends. After the divorce, there will be romantic developments.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Synopsis: </span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin Yuran never would have thought that the client sitting across from her, forcing them both to work together, was the high school classmate she had rejected long ago, Chi Ye.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two maintained a distant yet courteous relationship, keeping their distance as they worked together.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Lin Yuran gradually felt something wasn't quite right.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, why did this man insist on her working at his company instead of her own studio? And moreover, how come her office just so happened to be directly opposite his?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another instance, when Lin Yuran accepted a ride in another man's Rolls-Royce Phantom, Chi Ye only sighed, "I thought I'd never get to ride a luxury car like this in my life."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The very next day, Chi Ye's car changed to a Bentley, then Bugatti, followed by Koenigsegg... Another time, Lin Yuran accidentally stumbled upon Chi Ye's Baidu profile and discovered that her favorite lollipop factory was registered under his name.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But rumor had it that the factory closed five years ago, and that some mysterious big shot loved eating these lollipops, so he bought the factory and continued production regardless of profit or loss, no matter what the situation.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous clues led Lin Yuran to suspect—</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chi Ye still liked her?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Little did she know, even their second encounter was part of his plan.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Chi Ye remained unaware that on that sweltering afternoon six years ago, Lin Yuran had quietly watched his lonely figure from afar and murmured softly, "If we meet again someday, I hope I can respond to you."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, only the wind heard her confession.</span>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao died tragically.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The man she had saved and cared for for many years despised her and shattered her spirit veins with his own hands and dissolved her body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. I have waited for this day.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan's ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And Ning Yao's lifelong wish is to ascend.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft—those fools don’t know his worth. He’s from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it works, great. If not… well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions. When that happens, their instincts will turn against their beloved, giving rise to an uncontrollable urge to kill.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slay one’s beloved, attain enlightenment, ascend immediately, and forget the past.</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfect outcome for both.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao knew that Feng Jingzhuo had already begun to grow his heart’s scales.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, he endured the agonizing pain, hiding away to claw open his own chest. He ripped out the endlessly growing scales, pinned his own hands down with bone nails—desperately resisting his dragon instincts.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I beg you… whatever you do, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’ll be over soon. Be good. Stay outside…”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside, Ning Yao pondered, if</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we can both ascend, that’s better than neither of us ascending at all.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, she went in.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as she always did, she held him in her arms, kissing his trembling, pale lips with tenderness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After many 10 thousand years, Ning Yao was reborn and successfully ascended.</span>
She forgot Feng Jingzhou, but he remembered her.
Tormenting himself, he wanted to turn back time.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao was very happy, but the ceremony of conferring the gods was a little simple.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the entire world of gods was busy trying to stop a fallen god who wants to activate the forbidden Time-Reversal Array.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Theme: My heart is controlled by me, not by heavens.</span>

Later, after various events, Klaus became an adventurer and discovered a large egg deep in the forest. When he hatched it, a phoenix emerged.

      <description><![CDATA[General Qi Ren, known as the "Mad Wolf" was once an undefeated war god. However, he was poisoned by an enemy spy on the battlefield, which left him mentally impaired, leading to the tragic downfall of a legendary hero. The Emperor, relieved to have neutralized this formidable threat to his throne, felt a twinge of guilt. Hearing rumors that the "madman" harbored affection for the timid and mute Seventh Prince, Fu Yu'an, the Emperor decided to arrange their marriage, believing it to be a benevolent gesture.  
However, after the wedding, Fu Yu'an, who had to play both father and mother to the seemingly foolish general, was shocked when he saw the "madman" climbing into his bed with clear, calculating eyes. Fu Yu'an kicked him off and exclaimed, "You're not a fool?"  
To which Qi Ren retorted, "And you're not mute, are you? We're both hiding our true selves—so why the disdain?"

This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.
No! I don't want you to express it with your body either!]]></description>

Wei Qing calmed her mood and often looked at the obedient cute girl with loving eyes.
She nodded satisfactorily—she was a good child.
Wei Qing drank the water the girl handed her without caution.
She went to bed and felt especially sleepy today.
She grew somewhat drowsy...

      <description><![CDATA[A light-hearted, humorous, face-slapping, satisfying read.
A quirky and clever Alpha × a cold, black lotus Omega.
Jiang Ci transmigrated into the role of a cannon-fodder villain in an ancient ABO novel.
The original body, a prestigious first-rank military marquis with illustrious battle achievements, married the female lead out of lust for her beauty.
After marriage, his true nature was revealed: he imprisoned and abused her, and as a womanizer, he filled his courtyard with concubines, favoring them over his wife... In the end, he was mutilated by the blackened princess, who removed his gland, severed his limbs, and locked him in a pitch-dark dungeon.
When Jiang Ci transmigrated, she found herself straddling the female lead, engaged in unspeakable acts.
Jiang Ci immediately revealed her true self: "I'm not Gao Yi! I won't take the blame for this! I can even prove it by breakdancing!"
Female lead: "???"
The system issued a task: "Please fix the messed-up plot, torment the female lead, and promote her descent into darkness."
Jiang Ci: "No time for you."
System: "???"
…
Jiang Ci had been single for over twenty years and had only ever liked one fictional character.
Now that she had transmigrated into her lord, how could she not seize this heaven-sent opportunity?
No matter who you are, she would confront heaven and earth, and teach a lesson to anyone who bullied the female lead!
After all, she had become the villain—it would be a shame not to act domineering and arrogant!
She gave her all to the female lead, protecting her at every turn, helping her build her career, and imparting all her skills... Only to eventually realize that she was just a substitute, that the female lead had always harbored a white moonlight in her heart.
All the ambiguity between them was because she resembled that person.
Jiang Ci: "Can I know who she is?"
Female lead: "No."
Jiang Ci was finally numb. Heartbroken and disillusioned, she exchanged rewards with the system and returned to her original world.
…
Later, the woman who had ascended to the pinnacle of power got drunk at a palace banquet. "Have you found her?"
Maid: "Your Highness has forgotten, she was a soul transmigrator, not belonging to this world. We don't even know her real name."
The wine cup fell to the ground, and the woman's eyes dimmed.
…
When Jiang Ci woke up again, she found herself still in the novel, but now she had transmigrated into her own body, and ten years had passed.
The young girl she once needed to protect had now become the powerful and influential Grand Princess. It was said that this Grand Princess was cold and aloof, with her only peculiar hobby being to capture those with eccentric personalities and suspected of having delusions.
Jiang Ci wanted nothing to do with the Grand Princess this time and tried her best to keep her identity hidden.
However, the Grand Princess, after ten years, had thoroughly studied all of Jiang Ci's tactics, surpassing her teacher and excelling even further.

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Synopsis: </span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin Yuran never would have thought that the client sitting across from her, forcing them both to work together, was the high school classmate she had rejected long ago, Chi Ye.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two maintained a distant yet courteous relationship, keeping their distance as they worked together.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Lin Yuran gradually felt something wasn't quite right.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, why did this man insist on her working at his company instead of her own studio? And moreover, how come her office just so happened to be directly opposite his?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another instance, when Lin Yuran accepted a ride in another man's Rolls-Royce Phantom, Chi Ye only sighed, "I thought I'd never get to ride a luxury car like this in my life."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The very next day, Chi Ye's car changed to a Bentley, then Bugatti, followed by Koenigsegg... Another time, Lin Yuran accidentally stumbled upon Chi Ye's Baidu profile and discovered that her favorite lollipop factory was registered under his name.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But rumor had it that the factory closed five years ago, and that some mysterious big shot loved eating these lollipops, so he bought the factory and continued production regardless of profit or loss, no matter what the situation.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous clues led Lin Yuran to suspect—</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chi Ye still liked her?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Little did she know, even their second encounter was part of his plan.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Chi Ye remained unaware that on that sweltering afternoon six years ago, Lin Yuran had quietly watched his lonely figure from afar and murmured softly, "If we meet again someday, I hope I can respond to you."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, only the wind heard her confession.</span>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In the book, she is a useless person from a poor family. Because she is easy to control, Lu Zijin chooses her to be the redundant Alpha of the Lu family.
Originally, she could have just enjoyed the easy life provided, but she gradually became greedy. She not only covets the Lu family’s wealth but also wants to make the female lead, Lu Zijin, submit to her. She tries to harm Lu Zijin several times, but each attempt is exposed. In the end, Lu Zijin and her childhood friend break both of Wei Lan’s legs and throw her out of the Lu family.
A few days later, she dies.
Wei Lan frowns as she looks at the original book’s content: Is the easy life not good enough, or is jade not worth carving? Why would you go and provoke the female lead for no reason?
Learning her lesson, Wei Lan strictly follows the rules Lu Zijin sets for her, never crossing the line or actively seeking Lu Zijin’s attention. She rarely goes out, always holding a few unremarkable stones that she carves.
At first, Lu Zijin finds this redundant Alpha well-behaved. She only allows Wei Lan to share her bed during the heat period and sends her away afterward. Wei Lan never complains.
But gradually, Lu Zijin feels differently about this redundant Alpha. Even after the heat period, she enjoys being around Wei Lan. However, Wei Lan always declines because of the few rough stones she carries, making Lu Zijin dislike those stones.
Over the past year, the most popular jade carver in the Great Zhou Dynasty is Qing Lan. This carver is extremely mysterious, rarely appearing in public. Even when she does, she wears a mask and a wide black hooded cloak, hiding her face.
Her carvings are highly sought after and fetch high prices.
One evening, the so-called redundant Alpha who lives off others returns. Wei Lan holds a stack of silver notes, her eyes sparkling as she looks at Lu Zijin: “Wife, I sold my carved ornaments for a good price again.”
Lu Zijin looks at Wei Lan with gentle eyes: “Good job, very obedient. There’ll be a reward later.”

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Qing wakes up to find herself transported into an ancient famine novel, becoming a shameless rogue. During a famine, the original host scams food and drink in the city, committing all sorts of evil deeds. With an innocent and harmless face, she tricks the distressed Jiang Jinhuang into marrying her. After the marriage, the original host’s true nature is revealed. When Jiang Jinhuang refuses to consummate the marriage, the host relentlessly pressures and torments her, even nearly strangling Jiang Jinhuang’s younger sister to death. After enduring countless hardships, Jiang Jinhuang finally returns to the capital, where her family and childhood friend deal with the original host, whose final destination is a mass grave outside the city.
Ye Qing, having received the entire plot, plans to stay far away from Jiang Jinhuang and live well in this ancient world. But just as she prepares to leave, her personal system activates, unlocking the spatial ability from her previous life. Unlike before, her space now includes land and a spiritual spring. The system tells her that by earning Jiang Jinhuang’s favor, she can gain rewards to ensure she won’t starve during the famine.
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 potato seeds;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with a 2-pound carp;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 eggs…
Through her efforts, Ye Qing helps Jiang Jinhuang and her sister thrive during the famine. When she successfully escorts Jiang Jinhuang back to the capital and prepares to leave alone, Jiang Jinhuang’s eyes redden with tears.
Jiang Jinhuang, the daughter of the Minister of Rites, is separated from her family during a visit to Linzhou when they are scattered by rioters. After many struggles, she reaches Linzhou but fails to find her relatives. Lost and desperate, she believes Ye Qing’s words and temporarily marries her. However, after the marriage, Ye Qing becomes a different person, constantly abusing her. Then, one day, Ye Qing suddenly changes for the better, protecting Jiang Jinhuang and her sister, ensuring they never go hungry. Later, Ye Qing even escorts them back to the capital. When Ye Qing tries to leave, Jiang Jinhuang blocks the door, her fox-like eyes staring at Ye Qing with an unreadable expression, saying, “Where do you think you’re going, abandoning me?”

      <description><![CDATA[When Yu Jing was 19 years old, she still hadn’t differentiated, but it didn’t affect her image as a beautiful and strong Alpha in the eyes of her fans.
Three years after her debut, she won over a huge group of loyal fans while somehow gaining an enemy—actress Ming Zhu, known as the queen of ratings.
Ming Zhu was an Alpha; sheclashed with Yu Jing at an event, and Yu Jing thought they’d never cross paths again. But, by some twist of fate, they were invited to the same reality show.
Before filming even started, their fans were already tearing each other apart on Weibo.
Yu Jing couldn’t resist checking the comments and got angrier the more she read.
She could accept being called a has-been, and she could tolerate accusations of riding Ming Zhu’s fame. But someone dared question her gender, saying she’d definitely differentiate as an Omega???
Yu Jing suppressed the urge to jump into the fray, secretly swearing: Once I differentiate into a top-tier Alpha, I’ll crush all you haters and your idol into the ground!
Then she differentiated into a delicate Omega.
And got pinned against the wall by Ming Zhu.
In an intimate room—
Ming Zhu’s fingers brushed over the fragile skin hiding her gland, looking down at the person in her arms, her tone soft: “Are you okay?”
Yu Jing’s hands weakly clung to her neck, her cheeks flushed, her voice soft and pleading:
“Mark me already, please.”
<hr />
<strong>Warnings:</strong>
1. Lots of original world-building, Alphas don’t have male anatomy.
2. Melodramatic plot, slow-burn romance, proceed with caution if it’s not your thing.
Main Characters: Yu Jing, Ming Zhu | Supporting Characters: |

      <title>Dressed as the Scumbag Alpha Mom of the Tragic Female Lead (ABO, GL)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[What made Jiang Chuxie collapse even more than transmigrating into a blood-type novel was that she became the scumbag Alpha dad of the book’s female lead… or rather, mom?
The scumbag Alpha mom relied on the female lead’s mother, Gu Lingjun, to rise to wealth and prominence. She teamed up with her mistress to kill the original wife and seize the family fortune that should have belonged to the female lead, setting the stage for the female lead’s tragic life.
As for the ending, this scumbag Alpha naturally didn’t fare well either. She was ultimately ruined by her daughter’s six Alphas, left with a shattered family and no place to be buried.
Jiang Chuxie had no desire to follow in the original body’s footsteps. She didn’t want to be a scumbag, nor did she want to be killed. She just wanted to live peacefully… Wait, why does the person sleeping beside her look so much like… Gu Lingjun?
Jiang Chuxie couldn’t escape the fate of an ABO novel. Forced to marry due to pregnancy and reluctantly accepting her fate, the gentle Omega, who had always been submissive, suddenly changed drastically. She broke up, threw money at her, and ran off pregnant, turning the tables and making Jiang Chuxie the one who got played.
Jiang Chuxie: Wait, isn’t something off with this plot?
Gu Lingjun: If it’s off, that’s just right.

      <description><![CDATA[Shen Hanzhi woke up and found herself transmigrated into a novel as the villainous Alpha with the same name. The original Shen Hanzhi forced Wen Jin, a pitiful female protagonist from a fallen family, to marry her. She plundered Wen Jin’s possessions, forcibly marked her, and, after growing bored, brought a lover home to provoke the already pregnant Wen Jin.
Wen Jin lost her child and was imprisoned by Shen Hanzhi in a villa; she was completely blackened. Later, with the help of the male protagonist Liang Shuo, Wen Jin escaped the Shen family and ruined Shen Hanzhi’s reputation, leaving her as a madwoman on the streets.
Shen Hanzhi received the original novel’s plot. When she regained her senses, she was putting a wedding ring on Wen Jin’s finger. She turned to flee the wedding scene, but before she could move, her central nervous system received a shock.
Along with the shock, a strange voice echoed in her mind: The host cannot act out of character, or the villainous Alpha system will judge it as immediate death. At this, Shen Hanzhi felt completely numb!
Thus, Shen Hanzhi and Wen Jin’s daily life became like this:
Shen Hanzhi glared fiercely at Wen Jin: “You wrote my name so uglily, so you must write it ten more times as punishment!”
Shen Hanzhi stared at the delicate girl on the bed with a harsh tone: “I told you eight hundred times to eat more green peppers for nutrition, but you picked them out again!”
Wen Jin lived in a quagmire. She was an illegitimate daughter treated as a shame by the Wen family, living worse than a dog. Before leaving the Wen family at nineteen, she couldn’t even read.
A woman named Shen Hanzhi taught her to read, took her to various places to have fun, and gave her the life a person should have. Her Sister Shen was perfect in every way, except her tone sometimes sounded fierce.
But when Wen Jin watched TV, she understood it was the flirtation between wives, so she wasn’t afraid. When Wen Jin turned twenty, Shen Hanzhi finally accumulated enough villainous Alpha points to divorce the girl and live her own life.
But the girl hugged her neck and coquettishly said: “Sister, I like it when you bully me.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Yu Heyi received a wedding invitation from the Omega she had secretly loved for years, she was lying in a hospital bed.
She got into a car accident during a race and had to retire.
Under the double blow, Yu Heyi accepted her mom’s suggestion.
Going on a blind date.
Her mom praised the other person like crazy, saying they were a perfect Omega, beautiful and soft and gentle.
Then…
She found out the blind date was her most hated person, no one else came close!
Her love rival—Chi Ruixi.
She still hadn’t figured out how her beta love rival turned into an Omega.
And on the day of the blind date, she marked her.
It was Chi Ruixi, crying and begging her to mark her…
Afterward, Yu Heyi said three things.
“I’ll take responsibility, I’ll fulfill an Alpha’s duties.”
“I’ll treat you well, I’ll be considerate.”
“But don’t expect love.”
Chi Ruixi heard this, gave a slight smile, and said, “No need.”
Jobless Yu Heyi was arranged by her mom to work as a chef in the cafeteria of XX Middle School.
She found out the gentle and delicate literature teacher was—Chi Ruixi?
But Chi Ruixi’s cold words made her feel weird, a bit uncomfortable.
Yu Heyi thought it was pheromones that drew her to Chi Ruixi, otherwise why would she find
Chi Ruixi, the bridesmaid at the wedding, way more charming than the bride she’d loved for years.
Then, in a daze, she permanently marked Chi Ruixi.
Chi Ruixi kept waiting for that dumb Alpha to admit she loved her, but her dumb Alpha was truly dumb.

      <description><![CDATA[Zhou Yining died suddenly after 17 hours of intense work. When she woke up, she found herself transported into a romance novel, becoming the self-conscious and sensitive female lead.
The original character was a student at Nanchuan City No. 1 High School with average grades but secretly in love with the male lead, Zhang Ye. This caused the female supporting characters in the book to viciously slander her and even bully her at school. Among them, the one who hated the original character the most was the wealthy heiress Jiang Xianzhi.
After enduring persecution from her family, a series of school bullying incidents, and a physically and emotionally abusive relationship with the male lead, the original character finally achieved a happy ending with him.
Thinking about the original plot, Zhou Yining almost laughed in anger. That shitty male lead?
She didn’t care for him at all. It was her senior year, and clearly, the teachers hadn’t assigned enough homework if there was still time for this useless romantic nonsense.
Zhou Yining tore the original plot apart. She studied hard, aiming to top every subject. She rejected her family’s moral manipulation, gathered evidence to send those who bullied the original character to justice, and kicked the male lead, who loved to act cool for no reason, to the curb.
As she fought her way forward, she realized that the rich girl who used to hate her was actually kind of cute. When she got close, the rich girl would even blush?
Jiang Xianzhi realized she didn’t hate Zhou Yining anymore. Ever since Zhou Yining came back from being sick, she’d been acting strange. She wasn’t afraid of Jiang Xianzhi anymore and sometimes said weird things that made Jiang Xianzhi’s face turn red.
So Jiang Xianzhi’s daily life became:
September 2: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 3: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 4: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red…
September 13: After more than ten days of defeat, the rich girl decided to stand up for herself!
But on September 14, she was still teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red!

      <description><![CDATA[Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.
Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.
Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.
Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.
The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…
The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.
That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.
<hr />
Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.
Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.
At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.
He could smile, she realised, but not for her.
From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.
Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.
<hr />
After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.
But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.
On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”
Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”
Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.
For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[General Qi Ren, known as the "Mad Wolf" was once an undefeated war god. However, he was poisoned by an enemy spy on the battlefield, which left him mentally impaired, leading to the tragic downfall of a legendary hero. The Emperor, relieved to have neutralized this formidable threat to his throne, felt a twinge of guilt. Hearing rumors that the "madman" harbored affection for the timid and mute Seventh Prince, Fu Yu'an, the Emperor decided to arrange their marriage, believing it to be a benevolent gesture.  
However, after the wedding, Fu Yu'an, who had to play both father and mother to the seemingly foolish general, was shocked when he saw the "madman" climbing into his bed with clear, calculating eyes. Fu Yu'an kicked him off and exclaimed, "You're not a fool?"  
To which Qi Ren retorted, "And you're not mute, are you? We're both hiding our true selves—so why the disdain?"

      <description><![CDATA[Shin Jisoo is an ordinary woman in her thirties, but her life is a mess. Work is stressful, people are tiring, and now she even has to stop drinking. Feeling desperate, she goes to a shaman. But the shaman says something strange:
<i>“You’re in for huge bad luck. Really big trouble.”</i><i></i>
To stop this bad luck, Jisoo must meet a “big man.” It sounds silly— but then she really meets him. Chae Juwon is handsome and too charming to trust.
“I’ll tell you now— I don’t know why you’re here, but I’m not interested. I never sleep with people the old man sets me up with.”<i></i>
Juwon is bold and sly. He shocks Jisoo the first time they meet. And by accident, she finds out that the “big” rumor about him is true.
“So, did you get my number just to try it out?”<i></i>
Jisoo just wants a quiet life, but Juwon keeps pulling her into trouble. Still, in this mess, she finds new chances and feelings she can’t ignore.
“Why are you so kind to me, Mr. Chae?”
“I don’t know. I just want to be kind to you, Ms. Shin.”
As her biggest problem gets closer, this man keeps showing up. Can Jisoo really grab her “big luck” — or will it run away again?]]></description>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><em>Choi Muk-hyun</em></strong> – The infamous ‘cleaner’ for Samun Group, a crime syndicate known for its dirty dealings. Born as an illegitimate child of a chaebol family, he’s made his name in the shadows but is left with nothing but the reputation of being human trash. With no hope left in life, he drifts through each day in dull indifference.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Female Lead:</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><em>Irang</em></strong> – The hidden child of a district attorney famous for his integrity. A sunflower who’s always lived in the shadows. Her one dying wish is to step into the light, just once, before she goes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Story Introduction</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To me, the world was nothing more than a small, closed-off room.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A life where I had no say in anything at all.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At the edge of my life, melting away like candle wax, I was quietly dying.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And then, one day, a man opened the door and walked in.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Calm down. You’re bleeding.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He was the first person who ever looked at me like that.’</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Will you come with me?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why—<em>without even knowing who he was</em>—I grabbed his coat without hesitation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you think I’m a good person or a bad person?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He was cold, frightening, and a complete stranger.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“A… good person.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, it didn’t matter if he was bad.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As long as he could take me away from here.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Male Lead:</strong> <em>Kang Tae-shin</em> — owner of 4, Cheonghae-dong 118-gil. His work is as unusual as his mysterious aura.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Female Lead:</strong> <em>Woo Seula</em> — her life turned upside down after a sudden outbreak on her skin. While desperately looking for a cure, she crosses paths with Kang Taeshin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When to Read:</strong> When you want a romantic comedy wrapped up in exorcism and fate.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Story Intro</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Woo Seula’s whole body suddenly breaks out in a rash, and no doctor can explain. After trying everything she can think of, she finally goes to see a shaman — and finds out what she has is called Mudoo.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Following the shaman’s instructions, she heads to Cheonghae-dong 118-gil 4 — and that’s where she meets a man named Kang Tae-shin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Seula, I’d like you to help me with my work.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t work at night. I’m a morning person — I need to stick to a routine and be active during the day.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Three days from now. Ten at night. Come to Cheonghae-dong.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">She thought he was just some weirdo — but after meeting him, the Mudoo clears up completely, and her body feels light again.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Except… now she’s seeing things she shouldn’t be seeing — and panic sets in.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it really that scary, seeing what’s in front of you?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“…Can’t you make it so I don’t see them again?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Just pretend you don’t see, don’t hear, don’t feel anything. Act exactly like you did before your third eye opened.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A man whose true nature is a mystery — Kang Tae-shin — and Donggil, a talking dog who claims he’s a spirit.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Living with them, Seula has no choice but to exorcise ghosts — in this strange, chilly story full of secrets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Still, if you ever get too scared… come to me.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Tonight, I’ll come pick you up.”</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Synopsis: </span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin Yuran never would have thought that the client sitting across from her, forcing them both to work together, was the high school classmate she had rejected long ago, Chi Ye.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two maintained a distant yet courteous relationship, keeping their distance as they worked together.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Lin Yuran gradually felt something wasn't quite right.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, why did this man insist on her working at his company instead of her own studio? And moreover, how come her office just so happened to be directly opposite his?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another instance, when Lin Yuran accepted a ride in another man's Rolls-Royce Phantom, Chi Ye only sighed, "I thought I'd never get to ride a luxury car like this in my life."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The very next day, Chi Ye's car changed to a Bentley, then Bugatti, followed by Koenigsegg... Another time, Lin Yuran accidentally stumbled upon Chi Ye's Baidu profile and discovered that her favorite lollipop factory was registered under his name.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But rumor had it that the factory closed five years ago, and that some mysterious big shot loved eating these lollipops, so he bought the factory and continued production regardless of profit or loss, no matter what the situation.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous clues led Lin Yuran to suspect—</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chi Ye still liked her?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Little did she know, even their second encounter was part of his plan.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Chi Ye remained unaware that on that sweltering afternoon six years ago, Lin Yuran had quietly watched his lonely figure from afar and murmured softly, "If we meet again someday, I hope I can respond to you."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, only the wind heard her confession.</span>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing'an Marquis's residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle's family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke's residence was snatched away by her stepsister.
After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.
The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.
This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.
The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.
To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.
However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.
When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.
The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.
It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.
She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.
While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.
Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!
————
At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.
At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.
The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.
Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.
And all the girl asked for in return was—
"Sister, kiss me."
"Sister, hug me."
"Sister, cuddle me."
The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.
Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl's "concubine" while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.
————
Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.
Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.
“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”
Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—]]></description>

Bai Qing Yan said: Young Master Xiao has misunderstood.

It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.
But what happened to her in the end?

If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.

      <description><![CDATA[Summary 1:
"Even if it's a one-for-one trade, I will take over his company."
These were the last words Luan Yenan said before transmigrating into a book.
As the sole head of a Fortune 500 investment company, she never expected her end to be dying from overwork after three sleepless days and nights, only to transmigrate into a novel.
The character she transmigrated into was a crazy, abusive Alpha who tormented the female lead before having her glands removed by the seemingly innocent but secretly cunning female lead.
Crazy? Perfect, I’m crazy too.
Abusive Alpha? Sorry, I’m single and not interested.
As for the female lead, are you talking about the little girl I’ve pinned down, teary-eyed and begging for mercy?
Seemingly innocent but secretly cunning? Interesting.
Let me personally train her. I want to see how she plans to cut out my glands.
Summary 2:
Zuo Baixuan, who had just differentiated into an Omega, was sold by her adoptive parents to a crazy, abusive Alpha. She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.
Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, "I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early."
After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.
One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: "I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce."
Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: "I’ve already graduated."
"So?"
"I want to have a child. With you."
Let’s see who’s really the crazy one.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In the book, she is a useless person from a poor family. Because she is easy to control, Lu Zijin chooses her to be the redundant Alpha of the Lu family.
Originally, she could have just enjoyed the easy life provided, but she gradually became greedy. She not only covets the Lu family’s wealth but also wants to make the female lead, Lu Zijin, submit to her. She tries to harm Lu Zijin several times, but each attempt is exposed. In the end, Lu Zijin and her childhood friend break both of Wei Lan’s legs and throw her out of the Lu family.
A few days later, she dies.
Wei Lan frowns as she looks at the original book’s content: Is the easy life not good enough, or is jade not worth carving? Why would you go and provoke the female lead for no reason?
Learning her lesson, Wei Lan strictly follows the rules Lu Zijin sets for her, never crossing the line or actively seeking Lu Zijin’s attention. She rarely goes out, always holding a few unremarkable stones that she carves.
At first, Lu Zijin finds this redundant Alpha well-behaved. She only allows Wei Lan to share her bed during the heat period and sends her away afterward. Wei Lan never complains.
But gradually, Lu Zijin feels differently about this redundant Alpha. Even after the heat period, she enjoys being around Wei Lan. However, Wei Lan always declines because of the few rough stones she carries, making Lu Zijin dislike those stones.
Over the past year, the most popular jade carver in the Great Zhou Dynasty is Qing Lan. This carver is extremely mysterious, rarely appearing in public. Even when she does, she wears a mask and a wide black hooded cloak, hiding her face.
Her carvings are highly sought after and fetch high prices.
One evening, the so-called redundant Alpha who lives off others returns. Wei Lan holds a stack of silver notes, her eyes sparkling as she looks at Lu Zijin: “Wife, I sold my carved ornaments for a good price again.”
Lu Zijin looks at Wei Lan with gentle eyes: “Good job, very obedient. There’ll be a reward later.”

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Qing wakes up to find herself transported into an ancient famine novel, becoming a shameless rogue. During a famine, the original host scams food and drink in the city, committing all sorts of evil deeds. With an innocent and harmless face, she tricks the distressed Jiang Jinhuang into marrying her. After the marriage, the original host’s true nature is revealed. When Jiang Jinhuang refuses to consummate the marriage, the host relentlessly pressures and torments her, even nearly strangling Jiang Jinhuang’s younger sister to death. After enduring countless hardships, Jiang Jinhuang finally returns to the capital, where her family and childhood friend deal with the original host, whose final destination is a mass grave outside the city.
Ye Qing, having received the entire plot, plans to stay far away from Jiang Jinhuang and live well in this ancient world. But just as she prepares to leave, her personal system activates, unlocking the spatial ability from her previous life. Unlike before, her space now includes land and a spiritual spring. The system tells her that by earning Jiang Jinhuang’s favor, she can gain rewards to ensure she won’t starve during the famine.
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 potato seeds;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with a 2-pound carp;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 eggs…
Through her efforts, Ye Qing helps Jiang Jinhuang and her sister thrive during the famine. When she successfully escorts Jiang Jinhuang back to the capital and prepares to leave alone, Jiang Jinhuang’s eyes redden with tears.
Jiang Jinhuang, the daughter of the Minister of Rites, is separated from her family during a visit to Linzhou when they are scattered by rioters. After many struggles, she reaches Linzhou but fails to find her relatives. Lost and desperate, she believes Ye Qing’s words and temporarily marries her. However, after the marriage, Ye Qing becomes a different person, constantly abusing her. Then, one day, Ye Qing suddenly changes for the better, protecting Jiang Jinhuang and her sister, ensuring they never go hungry. Later, Ye Qing even escorts them back to the capital. When Ye Qing tries to leave, Jiang Jinhuang blocks the door, her fox-like eyes staring at Ye Qing with an unreadable expression, saying, “Where do you think you’re going, abandoning me?”

      <description><![CDATA["Every day, a recurring hellish dream. Junseong is stuck in a world that feels like an endless loop, much like a roguelike game. It's a cursed world where he struggles every day. Two months have passed since he set foot in the zombie apocalypse world in his dreams. "Ha...." As soon as he woke up, his gaze was instinctively drawn to the internet broadcast that he habitually left on. -A major riot is occurring in some regions due to the current situation... Then, beep! A loud sound announcing a disaster alert echoed in Junseong's head. Unconsciously picking up his phone along with the alarm sound, Junseong couldn't hide his confused expression.
[10:44 AM] It was the exact time he had always woken up in his dream. Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. "I've been wanting to ask you something."
"What?" As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo's gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. "Why do you look at me like that?" Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. "How am I... looking at you?"
"...." Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the 'fake smile' he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of blood was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of blood from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his 'clothes' but emanated from him.``]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[When Yu Jing was 19 years old, she still hadn’t differentiated, but it didn’t affect her image as a beautiful and strong Alpha in the eyes of her fans.
Three years after her debut, she won over a huge group of loyal fans while somehow gaining an enemy—actress Ming Zhu, known as the queen of ratings.
Ming Zhu was an Alpha; sheclashed with Yu Jing at an event, and Yu Jing thought they’d never cross paths again. But, by some twist of fate, they were invited to the same reality show.
Before filming even started, their fans were already tearing each other apart on Weibo.
Yu Jing couldn’t resist checking the comments and got angrier the more she read.
She could accept being called a has-been, and she could tolerate accusations of riding Ming Zhu’s fame. But someone dared question her gender, saying she’d definitely differentiate as an Omega???
Yu Jing suppressed the urge to jump into the fray, secretly swearing: Once I differentiate into a top-tier Alpha, I’ll crush all you haters and your idol into the ground!
Then she differentiated into a delicate Omega.
And got pinned against the wall by Ming Zhu.
In an intimate room—
Ming Zhu’s fingers brushed over the fragile skin hiding her gland, looking down at the person in her arms, her tone soft: “Are you okay?”
Yu Jing’s hands weakly clung to her neck, her cheeks flushed, her voice soft and pleading:
“Mark me already, please.”
<hr />
<strong>Warnings:</strong>
1. Lots of original world-building, Alphas don’t have male anatomy.
2. Melodramatic plot, slow-burn romance, proceed with caution if it’s not your thing.

      <description><![CDATA[What made Jiang Chuxie collapse even more than transmigrating into a blood-type novel was that she became the scumbag Alpha dad of the book’s female lead… or rather, mom?
The scumbag Alpha mom relied on the female lead’s mother, Gu Lingjun, to rise to wealth and prominence. She teamed up with her mistress to kill the original wife and seize the family fortune that should have belonged to the female lead, setting the stage for the female lead’s tragic life.
As for the ending, this scumbag Alpha naturally didn’t fare well either. She was ultimately ruined by her daughter’s six Alphas, left with a shattered family and no place to be buried.
Jiang Chuxie had no desire to follow in the original body’s footsteps. She didn’t want to be a scumbag, nor did she want to be killed. She just wanted to live peacefully… Wait, why does the person sleeping beside her look so much like… Gu Lingjun?
Jiang Chuxie couldn’t escape the fate of an ABO novel. Forced to marry due to pregnancy and reluctantly accepting her fate, the gentle Omega, who had always been submissive, suddenly changed drastically. She broke up, threw money at her, and ran off pregnant, turning the tables and making Jiang Chuxie the one who got played.
Jiang Chuxie: Wait, isn’t something off with this plot?
Gu Lingjun: If it’s off, that’s just right.

      <description><![CDATA[A light-hearted, humorous, face-slapping, satisfying read.
A quirky and clever Alpha × a cold, black lotus Omega.
Jiang Ci transmigrated into the role of a cannon-fodder villain in an ancient ABO novel.
The original body, a prestigious first-rank military marquis with illustrious battle achievements, married the female lead out of lust for her beauty.
After marriage, his true nature was revealed: he imprisoned and abused her, and as a womanizer, he filled his courtyard with concubines, favoring them over his wife... In the end, he was mutilated by the blackened princess, who removed his gland, severed his limbs, and locked him in a pitch-dark dungeon.
When Jiang Ci transmigrated, she found herself straddling the female lead, engaged in unspeakable acts.
Jiang Ci immediately revealed her true self: "I'm not Gao Yi! I won't take the blame for this! I can even prove it by breakdancing!"
Female lead: "???"
The system issued a task: "Please fix the messed-up plot, torment the female lead, and promote her descent into darkness."
Jiang Ci: "No time for you."
System: "???"
…
Jiang Ci had been single for over twenty years and had only ever liked one fictional character.
Now that she had transmigrated into her lord, how could she not seize this heaven-sent opportunity?
No matter who you are, she would confront heaven and earth, and teach a lesson to anyone who bullied the female lead!
After all, she had become the villain—it would be a shame not to act domineering and arrogant!
She gave her all to the female lead, protecting her at every turn, helping her build her career, and imparting all her skills... Only to eventually realize that she was just a substitute, that the female lead had always harbored a white moonlight in her heart.
All the ambiguity between them was because she resembled that person.
Jiang Ci: "Can I know who she is?"
Female lead: "No."
Jiang Ci was finally numb. Heartbroken and disillusioned, she exchanged rewards with the system and returned to her original world.
…
Later, the woman who had ascended to the pinnacle of power got drunk at a palace banquet. "Have you found her?"
Maid: "Your Highness has forgotten, she was a soul transmigrator, not belonging to this world. We don't even know her real name."
The wine cup fell to the ground, and the woman's eyes dimmed.
…
When Jiang Ci woke up again, she found herself still in the novel, but now she had transmigrated into her own body, and ten years had passed.
The young girl she once needed to protect had now become the powerful and influential Grand Princess. It was said that this Grand Princess was cold and aloof, with her only peculiar hobby being to capture those with eccentric personalities and suspected of having delusions.
Jiang Ci wanted nothing to do with the Grand Princess this time and tried her best to keep her identity hidden.
However, the Grand Princess, after ten years, had thoroughly studied all of Jiang Ci's tactics, surpassing her teacher and excelling even further.

"...Ah, I got it right this time? Yeah, I'll use this for my fiancé. What of it?" Ian's voice continued soothingly. "Even if I just torment him a little, that young master will run off crying to his daddy. If he's an alpha, he might even be traumatized."
In this world, is this a dream or reality? Is my fiancé now buying adult toys from my favorite club just to torment me? That sounded far more alluring and sweet than any love confession Noah had ever heard. Noah immediately changed the resolve he had just made to not marry Ian Miller. Someone who would even pluck a star from the sky for him is nothing special, and someone who hates him is nothing special either, but someone who will torment him is most welcome. This marriage must happen! It absolutely must! The delusion and love between a lovable, cute masochist and a lone, serious bad guy!]]></description>

The original Shen Hanzhi forced Wen Jin, a pitiful female protagonist from a fallen family, to marry her. She plundered Wen Jin’s possessions, forcibly marked her, and, after growing bored, brought a lover home to provoke the already pregnant Wen Jin.
Wen Jin lost her child and was imprisoned by Shen Hanzhi in a villa; she was completely blackened. Later, with the help of the male protagonist Liang Shuo, Wen Jin escaped the Shen family and ruined Shen Hanzhi’s reputation, leaving her as a madwoman on the streets.
Shen Hanzhi received the original novel’s plot. When she regained her senses, she was putting a wedding ring on Wen Jin’s finger. She turned to flee the wedding scene, but before she could move, her central nervous system received a shock.
Along with the shock, a strange voice echoed in her mind: The host cannot act out of character, or the villainous Alpha system will judge it as immediate death. At this, Shen Hanzhi felt completely numb!
Thus, Shen Hanzhi and Wen Jin’s daily life became like this:
Shen Hanzhi glared fiercely at Wen Jin: “You wrote my name so uglily, so you must write it ten more times as punishment!”
Shen Hanzhi stared at the delicate girl on the bed with a harsh tone: “I told you eight hundred times to eat more green peppers for nutrition, but you picked them out again!”
Wen Jin lived in a quagmire. She was an illegitimate daughter treated as a shame by the Wen family, living worse than a dog. Before leaving the Wen family at nineteen, she couldn’t even read.
A woman named Shen Hanzhi taught her to read, took her to various places to have fun, and gave her the life a person should have. Her Sister Shen was perfect in every way, except her tone sometimes sounded fierce.
But when Wen Jin watched TV, she understood it was the flirtation between wives, so she wasn’t afraid. When Wen Jin turned twenty, Shen Hanzhi finally accumulated enough villainous Alpha points to divorce the girl and live her own life.
But the girl hugged her neck and coquettishly said: “Sister, I like it when you bully me.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[After drinking too much at my retirement celebration, I woke up to find myself inexplicably transformed into a beautiful young boy in another world. In this world where magic reigns supreme, there's a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a 'stud' in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Yu Heyi received a wedding invitation from the Omega she had secretly loved for years, she was lying in a hospital bed.
She got into a car accident during a race and had to retire.
Under the double blow, Yu Heyi accepted her mom’s suggestion.
Going on a blind date.
Her mom praised the other person like crazy, saying they were a perfect Omega, beautiful and soft and gentle.
Then…
She found out the blind date was her most hated person, no one else came close!
Her love rival—Chi Ruixi.
She still hadn’t figured out how her beta love rival turned into an Omega.
And on the day of the blind date, she marked her.
It was Chi Ruixi, crying and begging her to mark her…
Afterward, Yu Heyi said three things.
“I’ll take responsibility, I’ll fulfill an Alpha’s duties.”
“I’ll treat you well, I’ll be considerate.”
“But don’t expect love.”
Chi Ruixi heard this, gave a slight smile, and said, “No need.”
Jobless Yu Heyi was arranged by her mom to work as a chef in the cafeteria of XX Middle School.
She found out the gentle and delicate literature teacher was—Chi Ruixi?
But Chi Ruixi’s cold words made her feel weird, a bit uncomfortable.
Yu Heyi thought it was pheromones that drew her to Chi Ruixi, otherwise why would she find
Chi Ruixi, the bridesmaid at the wedding, way more charming than the bride she’d loved for years.
Then, in a daze, she permanently marked Chi Ruixi.
Chi Ruixi kept waiting for that dumb Alpha to admit she loved her, but her dumb Alpha was truly dumb.

      <title>After Becoming the Abused Heroine in a Campus Story</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Zhou Yining died suddenly after 17 hours of intense work. When she woke up, she found herself transported into a romance novel, becoming the self-conscious and sensitive female lead.
The original character was a student at Nanchuan City No. 1 High School with average grades but secretly in love with the male lead, Zhang Ye. This caused the female supporting characters in the book to viciously slander her and even bully her at school. Among them, the one who hated the original character the most was the wealthy heiress Jiang Xianzhi.
After enduring persecution from her family, a series of school bullying incidents, and a physically and emotionally abusive relationship with the male lead, the original character finally achieved a happy ending with him.
Thinking about the original plot, Zhou Yining almost laughed in anger. That shitty male lead?
She didn’t care for him at all. It was her senior year, and clearly, the teachers hadn’t assigned enough homework if there was still time for this useless romantic nonsense.
Zhou Yining tore the original plot apart. She studied hard, aiming to top every subject. She rejected her family’s moral manipulation, gathered evidence to send those who bullied the original character to justice, and kicked the male lead, who loved to act cool for no reason, to the curb.
As she fought her way forward, she realized that the rich girl who used to hate her was actually kind of cute. When she got close, the rich girl would even blush?
Jiang Xianzhi realized she didn’t hate Zhou Yining anymore. Ever since Zhou Yining came back from being sick, she’d been acting strange. She wasn’t afraid of Jiang Xianzhi anymore and sometimes said weird things that made Jiang Xianzhi’s face turn red.
So Jiang Xianzhi’s daily life became:
September 2: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 3: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 4: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red…
September 13: After more than ten days of defeat, the rich girl decided to stand up for herself!
But on September 14, she was still teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red!
