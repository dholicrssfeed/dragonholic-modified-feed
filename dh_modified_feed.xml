      <description><![CDATA[Shin Jisoo is an ordinary woman in her thirties, but her life is a mess. Work is stressful, people are tiring, and now she even has to stop drinking. Feeling desperate, she goes to a shaman. But the shaman says something strange:
<i>“You’re in for huge bad luck. Really big trouble.”</i><i></i>
To stop this bad luck, Jisoo must meet a “big man.” It sounds silly— but then she really meets him. Chae Juwon is handsome and too charming to trust.
“I’ll tell you now— I don’t know why you’re here, but I’m not interested. I never sleep with people the old man sets me up with.”<i></i>
Juwon is bold and sly. He shocks Jisoo the first time they meet. And by accident, she finds out that the “big” rumor about him is true.
“So, did you get my number just to try it out?”<i></i>
Jisoo just wants a quiet life, but Juwon keeps pulling her into trouble. Still, in this mess, she finds new chances and feelings she can’t ignore.
“Why are you so kind to me, Mr. Chae?”
“I don’t know. I just want to be kind to you, Ms. Shin.”
As her biggest problem gets closer, this man keeps showing up. Can Jisoo really grab her “big luck” — or will it run away again?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Wei Qing lived for over twenty years and never saw such a crazy crossing.
She was a straight woman, crossed into a porn game she played years ago.
She wondered why the hell it was a modified version.
Did it want to drive her mad?
——
Wei Qing calmed her mood and often looked at the obedient cute girl with loving eyes.
She nodded satisfactorily—she was a good child.
Wei Qing drank the water the girl handed her without caution.
She went to bed and felt especially sleepy today.
She grew somewhat drowsy...
——
<em>Today’s dream... why was it especially real?</em>
The girl was completely naked; she straddled her waist.

<strong>As a result--</strong>
<strong>During a blind date:</strong>
The blind date partner whispered, <em>"The girl at the next table has been staring at us. What's her deal?"</em>
<strong>During a date:</strong>
<em>"Xiao Shu, don't you feel like there's a girl secretly following us?"</em>
<strong>While booking a room:</strong>
Shu Yubai held the room card to open the door and found the girl who claimed to be her lifelong friend curled up on the bed in a slip dress, her clear black and white eyes quietly looking at her...
<strong>#Pretending to be straight is fun for a while, chasing a wife is a crematorium.</strong>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Li Suimei knew that Qin Qing would disdain to attend her engagement ceremony with Qin Zhan.
After all, as a vicious female supporting character, Li Suimei’s role as a stepping stone for the male and female leads was almost over.
Why would Qin Qing come to help her?
Li Suimei chuckled bitterly. She had heard rumors about Qin Qing being very protective of her loved ones, but she didn't know who had spread those rumors.
——At the engagement ceremony, Qin Qing, who was originally not supposed to attend, suddenly appeared. Wearing a snow-white wedding dress, she stood in the position that should have belonged to the male protagonist and said expressionlessly,
"Now, you are my wife."
Li Suimei: "..."
Didn't this person seem indifferent towards her just yesterday?
••••
Small Theater:
Qin Qing pinched Li Suimei's wrist, her gaze fierce, "Back then, I always thought, you invited me to dinner and movies, stayed up late with me to go through documents, hugged my arm and cried, calling me 'sister.' Whenever I got angry, you would get nervous, and you even walked in and out of my room in your pajamas. If that wasn't love, what was it?"
Li Suimei looked confused, "When did I bent?"
Qin Qing: "..."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Li Mohan was of Han blood, yet everyone in the family despised her. All she wanted was to keep her head down, endure quietly, and make it to the day she could stand on her own.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That was until the night her younger uncle, Han Yezhen, forced her down on the bed, drove his cock into her virgin body, and shattered everything. From then on, everything spiraled beyond her control.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">She tried to escape Han Yezhen’s advances, all while enduring her cousin’s bullying at school.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In despair, she came up with what she thought was the perfect solution.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">She schemed and stole away her cousin’s boyfriend, Qin Yuchen.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uncle… I have a boyfriend now.”</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Han Yezhen pressed a kiss against the thick waves of her hair. “Do you? Then tell me—how does your boyfriend fuck you?”</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Real uncle. Forced love. A desire laid in wait.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Han Yezhen was no good man—jealousy twisted him into madness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Li Mohan looked soft and delicate, but inside she was every bit as unhinged.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Qin Yuchen, the poor bastard, lost his mind too in the end.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A plot-driven smut novel: the process is 1v2, but the ending 1v1.</span>

      <description><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Male Lead:</strong> <em>Kang Tae-shin</em> — owner of 4, Cheonghae-dong 118-gil. His work is as unusual as his mysterious aura.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Female Lead:</strong> <em>Woo Seula</em> — her life turned upside down after a sudden outbreak on her skin. While desperately looking for a cure, she crosses paths with Kang Taeshin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When to Read:</strong> When you want a romantic comedy wrapped up in exorcism and fate.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Story Intro</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Woo Seula’s whole body suddenly breaks out in a rash, and no doctor can explain. After trying everything she can think of, she finally goes to see a shaman — and finds out what she has is called Mudoo.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Following the shaman’s instructions, she heads to Cheonghae-dong 118-gil 4 — and that’s where she meets a man named Kang Tae-shin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Seula, I’d like you to help me with my work.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t work at night. I’m a morning person — I need to stick to a routine and be active during the day.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Three days from now. Ten at night. Come to Cheonghae-dong.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">She thought he was just some weirdo — but after meeting him, the Mudoo clears up completely, and her body feels light again.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Except… now she’s seeing things she shouldn’t be seeing — and panic sets in.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it really that scary, seeing what’s in front of you?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“…Can’t you make it so I don’t see them again?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Just pretend you don’t see, don’t hear, don’t feel anything. Act exactly like you did before your third eye opened.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A man whose true nature is a mystery — Kang Tae-shin — and Donggil, a talking dog who claims he’s a spirit.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Living with them, Seula has no choice but to exorcise ghosts — in this strange, chilly story full of secrets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Still, if you ever get too scared… come to me.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Tonight, I’ll come pick you up.”</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<strong>This work includes coercive relationships, uncomfortable subjects, and so on.</strong>
A child was born. We loved each other, we were happy together, and we dreamed of a future as a family. But on the way to the obstetrics and gynecology clinic to meet the child in my belly. An unexpected accident happened. In that accident, Dokwon did not open his eyes for a long time, and when he finally came to his senses later...... “Omega?” He did not remember me. But I was okay. Because we loved each other more than anything. I believed without a doubt that we could go back to that time. Dokwon's words hurt, but it was bearable. It was endurable.
“You will regret it.”
“Me? What would I regret?”
“Saying that to me.”
“What?”
“Treating me roughly. Treating me like a money-grubbing person. Seeing me as an empty-headed omega who sprays pheromones everywhere. You will regret it very much later.”
But the world relentlessly pushed us to the edge of the cliff. And finally, “Let's end it here.”
“......Yes?”
“Get rid of the child.”
“......What did you say?”
“Let's not see any more ugly sights for no reason, and end it here. Yoo Eunsu.”
The end tore us apart. Standing alone at that end, I...... earnestly wished for death.

      <description><![CDATA[<strong>This work includes coercive relationships, uncomfortable subjects, and so on.</strong>
A child was born. We loved each other, we were happy together, and we dreamed of a future as a family. But on the way to the obstetrics and gynecology clinic to meet the child in my belly. An unexpected accident happened. In that accident, Dokwon did not open his eyes for a long time, and when he finally came to his senses later...... “Omega?” He did not remember me. But I was okay. Because we loved each other more than anything. I believed without a doubt that we could go back to that time. Dokwon's words hurt, but it was bearable. It was endurable.
“You will regret it.”
“Me? What would I regret?”
“Saying that to me.”
“What?”
“Treating me roughly. Treating me like a money-grubbing person. Seeing me as an empty-headed omega who sprays pheromones everywhere. You will regret it very much later.”
But the world relentlessly pushed us to the edge of the cliff. And finally, “Let's end it here.”
“......Yes?”
“Get rid of the child.”
“......What did you say?”
“Let's not see any more ugly sights for no reason, and end it here. Yoo Eunsu.”
The end tore us apart. Standing alone at that end, I...... earnestly wished for death.

      <description><![CDATA[<strong>This work includes coercive relationships, uncomfortable subjects, and so on.</strong>
A child was born. We loved each other, we were happy together, and we dreamed of a future as a family. But on the way to the obstetrics and gynecology clinic to meet the child in my belly. An unexpected accident happened. In that accident, Dokwon did not open his eyes for a long time, and when he finally came to his senses later...... “Omega?” He did not remember me. But I was okay. Because we loved each other more than anything. I believed without a doubt that we could go back to that time. Dokwon's words hurt, but it was bearable. It was endurable.
“You will regret it.”
“Me? What would I regret?”
“Saying that to me.”
“What?”
“Treating me roughly. Treating me like a money-grubbing person. Seeing me as an empty-headed omega who sprays pheromones everywhere. You will regret it very much later.”
But the world relentlessly pushed us to the edge of the cliff. And finally, “Let's end it here.”
“......Yes?”
“Get rid of the child.”
“......What did you say?”
“Let's not see any more ugly sights for no reason, and end it here. Yoo Eunsu.”
The end tore us apart. Standing alone at that end, I...... earnestly wished for death.

      <description><![CDATA[In the book, she is a useless person from a poor family. Because she is easy to control, Lu Zijin chooses her to be the redundant Alpha of the Lu family.
Originally, she could have just enjoyed the easy life provided, but she gradually became greedy. She not only covets the Lu family’s wealth but also wants to make the female lead, Lu Zijin, submit to her. She tries to harm Lu Zijin several times, but each attempt is exposed. In the end, Lu Zijin and her childhood friend break both of Wei Lan’s legs and throw her out of the Lu family.
A few days later, she dies.
Wei Lan frowns as she looks at the original book’s content: Is the easy life not good enough, or is jade not worth carving? Why would you go and provoke the female lead for no reason?
Learning her lesson, Wei Lan strictly follows the rules Lu Zijin sets for her, never crossing the line or actively seeking Lu Zijin’s attention. She rarely goes out, always holding a few unremarkable stones that she carves.
At first, Lu Zijin finds this redundant Alpha well-behaved. She only allows Wei Lan to share her bed during the heat period and sends her away afterward. Wei Lan never complains.
But gradually, Lu Zijin feels differently about this redundant Alpha. Even after the heat period, she enjoys being around Wei Lan. However, Wei Lan always declines because of the few rough stones she carries, making Lu Zijin dislike those stones.
Over the past year, the most popular jade carver in the Great Zhou Dynasty is Qing Lan. This carver is extremely mysterious, rarely appearing in public. Even when she does, she wears a mask and a wide black hooded cloak, hiding her face.
Her carvings are highly sought after and fetch high prices.
One evening, the so-called redundant Alpha who lives off others returns. Wei Lan holds a stack of silver notes, her eyes sparkling as she looks at Lu Zijin: “Wife, I sold my carved ornaments for a good price again.”
Lu Zijin looks at Wei Lan with gentle eyes: “Good job, very obedient. There’ll be a reward later.”

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Qing wakes up to find herself transported into an ancient famine novel, becoming a shameless rogue. During a famine, the original host scams food and drink in the city, committing all sorts of evil deeds. With an innocent and harmless face, she tricks the distressed Jiang Jinhuang into marrying her. After the marriage, the original host’s true nature is revealed. When Jiang Jinhuang refuses to consummate the marriage, the host relentlessly pressures and torments her, even nearly strangling Jiang Jinhuang’s younger sister to death. After enduring countless hardships, Jiang Jinhuang finally returns to the capital, where her family and childhood friend deal with the original host, whose final destination is a mass grave outside the city.
Ye Qing, having received the entire plot, plans to stay far away from Jiang Jinhuang and live well in this ancient world. But just as she prepares to leave, her personal system activates, unlocking the spatial ability from her previous life. Unlike before, her space now includes land and a spiritual spring. The system tells her that by earning Jiang Jinhuang’s favor, she can gain rewards to ensure she won’t starve during the famine.
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 potato seeds;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with a 2-pound carp;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 eggs…
Through her efforts, Ye Qing helps Jiang Jinhuang and her sister thrive during the famine. When she successfully escorts Jiang Jinhuang back to the capital and prepares to leave alone, Jiang Jinhuang’s eyes redden with tears.
Jiang Jinhuang, the daughter of the Minister of Rites, is separated from her family during a visit to Linzhou when they are scattered by rioters. After many struggles, she reaches Linzhou but fails to find her relatives. Lost and desperate, she believes Ye Qing’s words and temporarily marries her. However, after the marriage, Ye Qing becomes a different person, constantly abusing her. Then, one day, Ye Qing suddenly changes for the better, protecting Jiang Jinhuang and her sister, ensuring they never go hungry. Later, Ye Qing even escorts them back to the capital. When Ye Qing tries to leave, Jiang Jinhuang blocks the door, her fox-like eyes staring at Ye Qing with an unreadable expression, saying, “Where do you think you’re going, abandoning me?”

      <title>The Young Marquis Regrets Too Late</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.
Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.
Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.
Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.
The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…
The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.
That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.
<hr />
Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.
Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.
At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.
He could smile, she realised, but not for her.
From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.
Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.
<hr />
After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.
But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.
On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”
Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”
Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.
For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[When Yu Jing was 19 years old, she still hadn’t differentiated, but it didn’t affect her image as a beautiful and strong Alpha in the eyes of her fans.
Three years after her debut, she won over a huge group of loyal fans while somehow gaining an enemy—actress Ming Zhu, known as the queen of ratings.
Ming Zhu was an Alpha; sheclashed with Yu Jing at an event, and Yu Jing thought they’d never cross paths again. But, by some twist of fate, they were invited to the same reality show.
Before filming even started, their fans were already tearing each other apart on Weibo.
Yu Jing couldn’t resist checking the comments and got angrier the more she read.
She could accept being called a has-been, and she could tolerate accusations of riding Ming Zhu’s fame. But someone dared question her gender, saying she’d definitely differentiate as an Omega???
Yu Jing suppressed the urge to jump into the fray, secretly swearing: Once I differentiate into a top-tier Alpha, I’ll crush all you haters and your idol into the ground!
Then she differentiated into a delicate Omega.
And got pinned against the wall by Ming Zhu.
In an intimate room—
Ming Zhu’s fingers brushed over the fragile skin hiding her gland, looking down at the person in her arms, her tone soft: “Are you okay?”
Yu Jing’s hands weakly clung to her neck, her cheeks flushed, her voice soft and pleading:
“Mark me already, please.”

<strong>Warnings:</strong>
1. Lots of original world-building, Alphas don’t have male anatomy.
2. Melodramatic plot, slow-burn romance, proceed with caution if it’s not your thing.

      <description><![CDATA[What made Jiang Chuxie collapse even more than transmigrating into a blood-type novel was that she became the scumbag Alpha dad of the book’s female lead… or rather, mom?
The scumbag Alpha mom relied on the female lead’s mother, Gu Lingjun, to rise to wealth and prominence. She teamed up with her mistress to kill the original wife and seize the family fortune that should have belonged to the female lead, setting the stage for the female lead’s tragic life.
As for the ending, this scumbag Alpha naturally didn’t fare well either. She was ultimately ruined by her daughter’s six Alphas, left with a shattered family and no place to be buried.
Jiang Chuxie had no desire to follow in the original body’s footsteps. She didn’t want to be a scumbag, nor did she want to be killed. She just wanted to live peacefully… Wait, why does the person sleeping beside her look so much like… Gu Lingjun?
Jiang Chuxie couldn’t escape the fate of an ABO novel. Forced to marry due to pregnancy and reluctantly accepting her fate, the gentle Omega, who had always been submissive, suddenly changed drastically. She broke up, threw money at her, and ran off pregnant, turning the tables and making Jiang Chuxie the one who got played.
Jiang Chuxie: Wait, isn’t something off with this plot?
Gu Lingjun: If it’s off, that’s just right.

      <title>After the Top Idol Omega and I Started Living Together</title>

      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/after-the-top-idol-omega-and-i-started-living-together/chapter-20/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Summary One:
The unshakable number one idol of the music world, Jing Yuan, had never shown her face once in twelve years since her debut. The year she announced her retirement was also the year Lu Zhao began to shine.
On the day Lu Zhao won Best Singer of the Year, the media couldn't wait to crown her as the "New Number One Idol in Music." The topic trended for three days straight, and the two fanbases fought endlessly online.
Not long after, the official announcement stated that Jing Yuan would return and make a public appearance. Everyone speculated that Lu Zhao, from the same company, had threatened her position.
On the day of the live-streamed press conference, Jing Yuan made her first appearance with black hair and a red dress, stunning and seductive.
Just as people were marveling at her beauty, a bold reporter asked, "Ms. Jing Yuan, do you have anything to say to your junior colleague Lu Zhao?"
Jing Yuan smiled meaningfully, paused for a few seconds, then said, "I hope she comes home on time tonight."
Right after those words, the livestream lagged and the internet exploded. Tags like #JingYuanSuspectedToBeDatingLuZhao and #JingYuan+LuZhao shot to the top of the trending list.
No one knew the top idol Jing Yuan’s real name was Sheng Jingyu.
No one knew her gland was congenitally underdeveloped, and she couldn’t smell any Alpha pheromones.
Even fewer knew that Lu Zhao was the only Alpha whose scent Sheng Jingyu could perceive.
Summary Two:
The first time Lu Zhao met Sheng Jingyu, she was drinking alone in a booth for two.
With black hair over her shoulders and a thin dress hanging off them, she looked strikingly unique in the decadent bar.
She was completely drunk. Clearly, she had only retired from her idol career, yet she looked like a pitiful, abandoned drunk Alpha, even pulling off her own inhibitor patch.
The second time Lu Zhao saw her, she was sitting in the garden of an old house, using sign language to explain that she was her co-renting roommate.
Only then did Lu Zhao realize that the beautiful Omega she once called boring couldn't speak.
Sheng Jingyu claimed she had been a musician before losing her voice, so Lu Zhao often asked her for guidance.
Under her mentorship, Lu Zhao improved rapidly, but she always felt something was off.
Were they standing too close?
Did her hand really need to stay on her own lower abdomen?
If she moved higher, wouldn’t she be touching her gland?!
…
Before Lu Zhao could figure anything out, Sheng Jingyu’s inhibitors stopped working due to her gland issue.
In a room filled with the weak scent of green grape and absinthe, Lu Zhao was guided into giving her first-ever temporary mark.
Later, Lu Zhao found the notebook Sheng Jingyu used to communicate before learning sign language.
She realized the handwriting was identical to the autographed copy she had collected from a Jing Yuan fan special.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Shen Hanzhi woke up and found herself transmigrated into a novel as the villainous Alpha with the same name. The original Shen Hanzhi forced Wen Jin, a pitiful female protagonist from a fallen family, to marry her. She plundered Wen Jin’s possessions, forcibly marked her, and, after growing bored, brought a lover home to provoke the already pregnant Wen Jin.
Wen Jin lost her child and was imprisoned by Shen Hanzhi in a villa; she was completely blackened. Later, with the help of the male protagonist Liang Shuo, Wen Jin escaped the Shen family and ruined Shen Hanzhi’s reputation, leaving her as a madwoman on the streets.
Shen Hanzhi received the original novel’s plot. When she regained her senses, she was putting a wedding ring on Wen Jin’s finger. She turned to flee the wedding scene, but before she could move, her central nervous system received a shock.
Along with the shock, a strange voice echoed in her mind: The host cannot act out of character, or the villainous Alpha system will judge it as immediate death. At this, Shen Hanzhi felt completely numb!
Thus, Shen Hanzhi and Wen Jin’s daily life became like this:
Shen Hanzhi glared fiercely at Wen Jin: “You wrote my name so uglily, so you must write it ten more times as punishment!”
Shen Hanzhi stared at the delicate girl on the bed with a harsh tone: “I told you eight hundred times to eat more green peppers for nutrition, but you picked them out again!”
Wen Jin lived in a quagmire. She was an illegitimate daughter treated as a shame by the Wen family, living worse than a dog. Before leaving the Wen family at nineteen, she couldn’t even read.
A woman named Shen Hanzhi taught her to read, took her to various places to have fun, and gave her the life a person should have. Her Sister Shen was perfect in every way, except her tone sometimes sounded fierce.
But when Wen Jin watched TV, she understood it was the flirtation between wives, so she wasn’t afraid. When Wen Jin turned twenty, Shen Hanzhi finally accumulated enough villainous Alpha points to divorce the girl and live her own life.
But the girl hugged her neck and coquettishly said: “Sister, I like it when you bully me.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Yu Heyi received a wedding invitation from the Omega she had secretly loved for years, she was lying in a hospital bed.
She got into a car accident during a race and had to retire.
Under the double blow, Yu Heyi accepted her mom’s suggestion.
Going on a blind date.
Her mom praised the other person like crazy, saying they were a perfect Omega, beautiful and soft and gentle.
Then…
She found out the blind date was her most hated person, no one else came close!
Her love rival—Chi Ruixi.
She still hadn’t figured out how her beta love rival turned into an Omega.
And on the day of the blind date, she marked her.
It was Chi Ruixi, crying and begging her to mark her…
Afterward, Yu Heyi said three things.
“I’ll take responsibility, I’ll fulfill an Alpha’s duties.”
“I’ll treat you well, I’ll be considerate.”
“But don’t expect love.”
Chi Ruixi heard this, gave a slight smile, and said, “No need.”
Jobless Yu Heyi was arranged by her mom to work as a chef in the cafeteria of XX Middle School.
She found out the gentle and delicate literature teacher was—Chi Ruixi?
But Chi Ruixi’s cold words made her feel weird, a bit uncomfortable.
Yu Heyi thought it was pheromones that drew her to Chi Ruixi, otherwise why would she find
Chi Ruixi, the bridesmaid at the wedding, way more charming than the bride she’d loved for years.
Then, in a daze, she permanently marked Chi Ruixi.
Chi Ruixi kept waiting for that dumb Alpha to admit she loved her, but her dumb Alpha was truly dumb.

      <description><![CDATA[Zhou Yining died suddenly after 17 hours of intense work. When she woke up, she found herself transported into a romance novel, becoming the self-conscious and sensitive female lead.
The original character was a student at Nanchuan City No. 1 High School with average grades but secretly in love with the male lead, Zhang Ye. This caused the female supporting characters in the book to viciously slander her and even bully her at school. Among them, the one who hated the original character the most was the wealthy heiress Jiang Xianzhi.
After enduring persecution from her family, a series of school bullying incidents, and a physically and emotionally abusive relationship with the male lead, the original character finally achieved a happy ending with him.
Thinking about the original plot, Zhou Yining almost laughed in anger. That shitty male lead?
She didn’t care for him at all. It was her senior year, and clearly, the teachers hadn’t assigned enough homework if there was still time for this useless romantic nonsense.
Zhou Yining tore the original plot apart. She studied hard, aiming to top every subject. She rejected her family’s moral manipulation, gathered evidence to send those who bullied the original character to justice, and kicked the male lead, who loved to act cool for no reason, to the curb.
As she fought her way forward, she realized that the rich girl who used to hate her was actually kind of cute. When she got close, the rich girl would even blush?
Jiang Xianzhi realized she didn’t hate Zhou Yining anymore. Ever since Zhou Yining came back from being sick, she’d been acting strange. She wasn’t afraid of Jiang Xianzhi anymore and sometimes said weird things that made Jiang Xianzhi’s face turn red.
So Jiang Xianzhi’s daily life became:
September 2: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 3: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 4: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red…
September 13: After more than ten days of defeat, the rich girl decided to stand up for herself!
But on September 14, she was still teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red!

      <description><![CDATA[Jiang Ci didn’t expect the iceberg she spent a passionate night with last night to be Gu Feiran, the goddess her ex admired for so long.
Her heart suddenly felt a pang of loss.
In the hospital corridor, the other noticed her.
Wearing a white mask, hands in pockets, she walked straight over, her autumn-like watery eyes staring directly.
Their eyes met.
When she got close, she turned her gaze away, looked at the person beside her, and said, “Dr. Jiang, Bed 7 can process discharge procedures.”
Last night was an accident, but since she marked her, she had to take responsibility.
Later, as their relationship grew closer, Jiang Ci felt she couldn’t hold her back and ended it.
Hearing this, the other’s cool figure paused, her eyes darkened.
She said nothing and turned to leave.
Jiang Ci thought their story was over, but one late night, driving through the streets, she unexpectedly saw the cool, proud Dr. Gu standing by the roadside, one hand on a tree, looking like she might vomit.
Jiang Ci thought, even if they couldn’t be lovers, they were at least somewhat connected strangers; checking on her wouldn’t hurt.
She pulled the car over and walked up.
No smell of alcohol—could it be a bad stomach?
Seeing her vomit so painfully, Jiang Ci blurted out, “You’re a doctor and still got a bad stomach.”
Gu Feiran’s beautiful eyes lifted slightly, her gaze like a knife, “…”

She was a straight woman, crossed into a porn game she played years ago.
She wondered why the hell it was a modified version.
Did it want to drive her mad?
——
Wei Qing calmed her mood and often looked at the obedient cute girl with loving eyes.
She nodded satisfactorily—she was a good child.
Wei Qing drank the water the girl handed her without caution.
She went to bed and felt especially sleepy today.
She grew somewhat drowsy...
——
<em>Today’s dream... why was it especially real?</em>
The girl was completely naked; she straddled her waist.

      <description><![CDATA[Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.
Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.
Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.
Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.
The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…
The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.
That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.
<hr />
Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.
Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.
At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.
He could smile, she realised, but not for her.
From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.
Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.
<hr />
After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.
But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.
On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”
Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”
Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.
For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[If Shu Yue did not say it, very few people would realize that she was an Alpha.
She dressed plainly, always wore old-fashioned black-rimmed glasses on the bridge of her nose, and spoke and acted rigidly like a robot.
No one knew either that she and Meng Zhiyu, the most popular butterfly-like Omega in the art department, were a couple.
Meng Zhiyu pursued her. The two secretly dated from high school until now, and no one ever found out.
One day, Shu Yue was dumped by Meng Zhiyu.
Also on that day, Shu Yue picked up a cat in the pouring rain.
When a cold and mature great beauty came knocking, Shu Yue then realized that it was the spiritual body of the top-class Omega Ji Shiyi.
A little cat that always ignored others but acted sweet only in her palm.
And the first thing Ji Shiyi said to Shu Yue was, “Hello, I know this is abrupt, but could you please mark me?”
Heartbroken Shu Yue decided to help others for good.
But she really did not expect that the person she helped was the ex-aunt of her ex-girlfriend who was now trying to get back together with her, the head of the Ji family, and her research project’s boss.
Shu Yue: “…………”
Looking at the scene in front of her that had turned into a complete mess, Shu Yue only wanted to say—
Hello, is it still possible to undo a mark now?
*1v1, seven-year age gap, happy ending with the aunt, likely bittersweet and sweet.
*ABO setting
*The aunt’s spiritual body is actually a snow leopard beauty!

      <description><![CDATA[Shin Jisoo is an ordinary woman in her thirties, but her life is a mess. Work is stressful, people are tiring, and now she even has to stop drinking. Feeling desperate, she goes to a shaman. But the shaman says something strange:
<i>“You’re in for huge bad luck. Really big trouble.”</i><i></i>
To stop this bad luck, Jisoo must meet a “big man.” It sounds silly— but then she really meets him. Chae Juwon is handsome and too charming to trust.
“I’ll tell you now— I don’t know why you’re here, but I’m not interested. I never sleep with people the old man sets me up with.”<i></i>
Juwon is bold and sly. He shocks Jisoo the first time they meet. And by accident, she finds out that the “big” rumor about him is true.
“So, did you get my number just to try it out?”<i></i>
Jisoo just wants a quiet life, but Juwon keeps pulling her into trouble. Still, in this mess, she finds new chances and feelings she can’t ignore.
“Why are you so kind to me, Mr. Chae?”
“I don’t know. I just want to be kind to you, Ms. Shin.”
As her biggest problem gets closer, this man keeps showing up. Can Jisoo really grab her “big luck” — or will it run away again?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon waking, Shen Chiying discovered she was the vicious supporting villainess in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">His Majesty Regrets Too Late</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“He gave the empress’s seat that should have been hers to her concubine-born younger sister.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, on a night of torrential rain, the emperor stood alone outside a mountain temple, waiting in the cold for her forgiveness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after seizing the realm, Huan Jin’s heart from beginning to end held only the little girl who once helped him escape with his life.”</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">And Shen Chiying just happens to be the heroine’s malicious concubine-born sister…</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the book she’s willful and overbearing, big tits and no brains; to climb onto the newly enthroned male lead, she claims the heroine’s life-saving debt as her own.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One lie demands a hundred more, and Shen Chiying starts courting death—again and again framing her legitimate elder sister, the heroine.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end she reaps what she sowed: deposed from the empress’s seat, thrown into a dungeon, tortured daily by every cruel device, unable to live, unable to die.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing the plot ahead of time, Shen Chiying works all the harder when she serves in bed—eyes wet and sultry, obediently arching her perky ass to tend the dragon cock.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Your Majesty, there’s something this concubine wishes to confess…”</span>

      <description><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Male Lead:</strong> <em>Kang Tae-shin</em> — owner of 4, Cheonghae-dong 118-gil. His work is as unusual as his mysterious aura.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Female Lead:</strong> <em>Woo Seula</em> — her life turned upside down after a sudden outbreak on her skin. While desperately looking for a cure, she crosses paths with Kang Taeshin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When to Read:</strong> When you want a romantic comedy wrapped up in exorcism and fate.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Story Intro</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Woo Seula’s whole body suddenly breaks out in a rash, and no doctor can explain. After trying everything she can think of, she finally goes to see a shaman — and finds out what she has is called Mudoo.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Following the shaman’s instructions, she heads to Cheonghae-dong 118-gil 4 — and that’s where she meets a man named Kang Tae-shin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Seula, I’d like you to help me with my work.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t work at night. I’m a morning person — I need to stick to a routine and be active during the day.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Three days from now. Ten at night. Come to Cheonghae-dong.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">She thought he was just some weirdo — but after meeting him, the Mudoo clears up completely, and her body feels light again.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Except… now she’s seeing things she shouldn’t be seeing — and panic sets in.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it really that scary, seeing what’s in front of you?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“…Can’t you make it so I don’t see them again?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Just pretend you don’t see, don’t hear, don’t feel anything. Act exactly like you did before your third eye opened.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A man whose true nature is a mystery — Kang Tae-shin — and Donggil, a talking dog who claims he’s a spirit.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Living with them, Seula has no choice but to exorcise ghosts — in this strange, chilly story full of secrets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Still, if you ever get too scared… come to me.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Tonight, I’ll come pick you up.”</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Wen Zhao transmigrated into a low-magic Xianxia novel, only to discover she'd become the cannon fodder second female lead who bullied the female lead, seduced the male lead, and was generally a green tea b*tch, lotus-flower-like antagonist.
In the original novel, she was the catalyst for misunderstandings between the male and female leads, a dedicated tool character who lived until the grand finale. In the end, the male and female leads ended up together, while she suffered the consequences.
To avoid a bad ending, Wen Zhao tried her best to cling to the female lead without being too out of character, hoping to safely exit the story.
Although she was still being required by the system to perform actions befitting a second female lead, Wen Zhao believed the female lead would eventually understand her sincere heart!
However, it seemed like the female lead was looking at her a bit strangely?
••••
Male Lead: A Zhao, I suddenly realized that I might actually like you a little.
Wen Zhao: ???
She thought this was the biggest deviation from the plot, but then the female lead slowly approached.
Lowering her gaze slightly, the female lead, whose gaze was usually cold, revealed a hint of obsession and possessiveness. She walked up to Wen Zhao and smiled softly.
She asked softly, "A Zhao, between him and me, who do you choose?"
Wen Zhao: I choose you! I choose you!
••••
One-Sentence Summary: Thank you everyone, I'm with the female lead now.
Theme: Even when facing difficulties, one should strive to overcome them and have the determination to reverse their situation. Only through hard work can one achieve success. Victory and new surprises are waiting not far away.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In the book, she is a useless person from a poor family. Because she is easy to control, Lu Zijin chooses her to be the redundant Alpha of the Lu family.
Originally, she could have just enjoyed the easy life provided, but she gradually became greedy. She not only covets the Lu family’s wealth but also wants to make the female lead, Lu Zijin, submit to her. She tries to harm Lu Zijin several times, but each attempt is exposed. In the end, Lu Zijin and her childhood friend break both of Wei Lan’s legs and throw her out of the Lu family.
A few days later, she dies.
Wei Lan frowns as she looks at the original book’s content: Is the easy life not good enough, or is jade not worth carving? Why would you go and provoke the female lead for no reason?
Learning her lesson, Wei Lan strictly follows the rules Lu Zijin sets for her, never crossing the line or actively seeking Lu Zijin’s attention. She rarely goes out, always holding a few unremarkable stones that she carves.
At first, Lu Zijin finds this redundant Alpha well-behaved. She only allows Wei Lan to share her bed during the heat period and sends her away afterward. Wei Lan never complains.
But gradually, Lu Zijin feels differently about this redundant Alpha. Even after the heat period, she enjoys being around Wei Lan. However, Wei Lan always declines because of the few rough stones she carries, making Lu Zijin dislike those stones.
Over the past year, the most popular jade carver in the Great Zhou Dynasty is Qing Lan. This carver is extremely mysterious, rarely appearing in public. Even when she does, she wears a mask and a wide black hooded cloak, hiding her face.
Her carvings are highly sought after and fetch high prices.
One evening, the so-called redundant Alpha who lives off others returns. Wei Lan holds a stack of silver notes, her eyes sparkling as she looks at Lu Zijin: “Wife, I sold my carved ornaments for a good price again.”
Lu Zijin looks at Wei Lan with gentle eyes: “Good job, very obedient. There’ll be a reward later.”

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Qing wakes up to find herself transported into an ancient famine novel, becoming a shameless rogue. During a famine, the original host scams food and drink in the city, committing all sorts of evil deeds. With an innocent and harmless face, she tricks the distressed Jiang Jinhuang into marrying her. After the marriage, the original host’s true nature is revealed. When Jiang Jinhuang refuses to consummate the marriage, the host relentlessly pressures and torments her, even nearly strangling Jiang Jinhuang’s younger sister to death. After enduring countless hardships, Jiang Jinhuang finally returns to the capital, where her family and childhood friend deal with the original host, whose final destination is a mass grave outside the city.
Ye Qing, having received the entire plot, plans to stay far away from Jiang Jinhuang and live well in this ancient world. But just as she prepares to leave, her personal system activates, unlocking the spatial ability from her previous life. Unlike before, her space now includes land and a spiritual spring. The system tells her that by earning Jiang Jinhuang’s favor, she can gain rewards to ensure she won’t starve during the famine.
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 potato seeds;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with a 2-pound carp;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 eggs…
Through her efforts, Ye Qing helps Jiang Jinhuang and her sister thrive during the famine. When she successfully escorts Jiang Jinhuang back to the capital and prepares to leave alone, Jiang Jinhuang’s eyes redden with tears.
Jiang Jinhuang, the daughter of the Minister of Rites, is separated from her family during a visit to Linzhou when they are scattered by rioters. After many struggles, she reaches Linzhou but fails to find her relatives. Lost and desperate, she believes Ye Qing’s words and temporarily marries her. However, after the marriage, Ye Qing becomes a different person, constantly abusing her. Then, one day, Ye Qing suddenly changes for the better, protecting Jiang Jinhuang and her sister, ensuring they never go hungry. Later, Ye Qing even escorts them back to the capital. When Ye Qing tries to leave, Jiang Jinhuang blocks the door, her fox-like eyes staring at Ye Qing with an unreadable expression, saying, “Where do you think you’re going, abandoning me?”

      <description><![CDATA[When Yu Jing was 19 years old, she still hadn’t differentiated, but it didn’t affect her image as a beautiful and strong Alpha in the eyes of her fans.
Three years after her debut, she won over a huge group of loyal fans while somehow gaining an enemy—actress Ming Zhu, known as the queen of ratings.
Ming Zhu was an Alpha; sheclashed with Yu Jing at an event, and Yu Jing thought they’d never cross paths again. But, by some twist of fate, they were invited to the same reality show.
Before filming even started, their fans were already tearing each other apart on Weibo.
Yu Jing couldn’t resist checking the comments and got angrier the more she read.
She could accept being called a has-been, and she could tolerate accusations of riding Ming Zhu’s fame. But someone dared question her gender, saying she’d definitely differentiate as an Omega???
Yu Jing suppressed the urge to jump into the fray, secretly swearing: Once I differentiate into a top-tier Alpha, I’ll crush all you haters and your idol into the ground!
Then she differentiated into a delicate Omega.
And got pinned against the wall by Ming Zhu.
In an intimate room—
Ming Zhu’s fingers brushed over the fragile skin hiding her gland, looking down at the person in her arms, her tone soft: “Are you okay?”
Yu Jing’s hands weakly clung to her neck, her cheeks flushed, her voice soft and pleading:
“Mark me already, please.”
<hr />
<strong>Warnings:</strong>
1. Lots of original world-building, Alphas don’t have male anatomy.
2. Melodramatic plot, slow-burn romance, proceed with caution if it’s not your thing.

      <description><![CDATA[What made Jiang Chuxie collapse even more than transmigrating into a blood-type novel was that she became the scumbag Alpha dad of the book’s female lead… or rather, mom?
The scumbag Alpha mom relied on the female lead’s mother, Gu Lingjun, to rise to wealth and prominence. She teamed up with her mistress to kill the original wife and seize the family fortune that should have belonged to the female lead, setting the stage for the female lead’s tragic life.
As for the ending, this scumbag Alpha naturally didn’t fare well either. She was ultimately ruined by her daughter’s six Alphas, left with a shattered family and no place to be buried.
Jiang Chuxie had no desire to follow in the original body’s footsteps. She didn’t want to be a scumbag, nor did she want to be killed. She just wanted to live peacefully… Wait, why does the person sleeping beside her look so much like… Gu Lingjun?
Jiang Chuxie couldn’t escape the fate of an ABO novel. Forced to marry due to pregnancy and reluctantly accepting her fate, the gentle Omega, who had always been submissive, suddenly changed drastically. She broke up, threw money at her, and ran off pregnant, turning the tables and making Jiang Chuxie the one who got played.
Jiang Chuxie: Wait, isn’t something off with this plot?
Gu Lingjun: If it’s off, that’s just right.

      <title>After the Top Idol Omega and I Started Living Together</title>
      <volume/>
      <chaptername>Chapter 19</chaptername>

      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/after-the-top-idol-omega-and-i-started-living-together/chapter-19/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Summary One:
The unshakable number one idol of the music world, Jing Yuan, had never shown her face once in twelve years since her debut. The year she announced her retirement was also the year Lu Zhao began to shine.
On the day Lu Zhao won Best Singer of the Year, the media couldn't wait to crown her as the "New Number One Idol in Music." The topic trended for three days straight, and the two fanbases fought endlessly online.
Not long after, the official announcement stated that Jing Yuan would return and make a public appearance. Everyone speculated that Lu Zhao, from the same company, had threatened her position.
On the day of the live-streamed press conference, Jing Yuan made her first appearance with black hair and a red dress, stunning and seductive.
Just as people were marveling at her beauty, a bold reporter asked, "Ms. Jing Yuan, do you have anything to say to your junior colleague Lu Zhao?"
Jing Yuan smiled meaningfully, paused for a few seconds, then said, "I hope she comes home on time tonight."
Right after those words, the livestream lagged and the internet exploded. Tags like #JingYuanSuspectedToBeDatingLuZhao and #JingYuan+LuZhao shot to the top of the trending list.
No one knew the top idol Jing Yuan’s real name was Sheng Jingyu.
No one knew her gland was congenitally underdeveloped, and she couldn’t smell any Alpha pheromones.
Even fewer knew that Lu Zhao was the only Alpha whose scent Sheng Jingyu could perceive.
Summary Two:
The first time Lu Zhao met Sheng Jingyu, she was drinking alone in a booth for two.
With black hair over her shoulders and a thin dress hanging off them, she looked strikingly unique in the decadent bar.
She was completely drunk. Clearly, she had only retired from her idol career, yet she looked like a pitiful, abandoned drunk Alpha, even pulling off her own inhibitor patch.
The second time Lu Zhao saw her, she was sitting in the garden of an old house, using sign language to explain that she was her co-renting roommate.
Only then did Lu Zhao realize that the beautiful Omega she once called boring couldn't speak.
Sheng Jingyu claimed she had been a musician before losing her voice, so Lu Zhao often asked her for guidance.
Under her mentorship, Lu Zhao improved rapidly, but she always felt something was off.
Were they standing too close?
Did her hand really need to stay on her own lower abdomen?
If she moved higher, wouldn’t she be touching her gland?!
…
Before Lu Zhao could figure anything out, Sheng Jingyu’s inhibitors stopped working due to her gland issue.
In a room filled with the weak scent of green grape and absinthe, Lu Zhao was guided into giving her first-ever temporary mark.
Later, Lu Zhao found the notebook Sheng Jingyu used to communicate before learning sign language.
She realized the handwriting was identical to the autographed copy she had collected from a Jing Yuan fan special.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Yu Heyi received a wedding invitation from the Omega she had secretly loved for years, she was lying in a hospital bed.
She got into a car accident during a race and had to retire.
Under the double blow, Yu Heyi accepted her mom’s suggestion.
Going on a blind date.
Her mom praised the other person like crazy, saying they were a perfect Omega, beautiful and soft and gentle.
Then…
She found out the blind date was her most hated person, no one else came close!
Her love rival—Chi Ruixi.
She still hadn’t figured out how her beta love rival turned into an Omega.
And on the day of the blind date, she marked her.
It was Chi Ruixi, crying and begging her to mark her…
Afterward, Yu Heyi said three things.
“I’ll take responsibility, I’ll fulfill an Alpha’s duties.”
“I’ll treat you well, I’ll be considerate.”
“But don’t expect love.”
Chi Ruixi heard this, gave a slight smile, and said, “No need.”
Jobless Yu Heyi was arranged by her mom to work as a chef in the cafeteria of XX Middle School.
She found out the gentle and delicate literature teacher was—Chi Ruixi?
But Chi Ruixi’s cold words made her feel weird, a bit uncomfortable.
Yu Heyi thought it was pheromones that drew her to Chi Ruixi, otherwise why would she find
Chi Ruixi, the bridesmaid at the wedding, way more charming than the bride she’d loved for years.
Then, in a daze, she permanently marked Chi Ruixi.
Chi Ruixi kept waiting for that dumb Alpha to admit she loved her, but her dumb Alpha was truly dumb.

      <description><![CDATA[Zhou Yining died suddenly after 17 hours of intense work. When she woke up, she found herself transported into a romance novel, becoming the self-conscious and sensitive female lead.
The original character was a student at Nanchuan City No. 1 High School with average grades but secretly in love with the male lead, Zhang Ye. This caused the female supporting characters in the book to viciously slander her and even bully her at school. Among them, the one who hated the original character the most was the wealthy heiress Jiang Xianzhi.
After enduring persecution from her family, a series of school bullying incidents, and a physically and emotionally abusive relationship with the male lead, the original character finally achieved a happy ending with him.
Thinking about the original plot, Zhou Yining almost laughed in anger. That shitty male lead?
She didn’t care for him at all. It was her senior year, and clearly, the teachers hadn’t assigned enough homework if there was still time for this useless romantic nonsense.
Zhou Yining tore the original plot apart. She studied hard, aiming to top every subject. She rejected her family’s moral manipulation, gathered evidence to send those who bullied the original character to justice, and kicked the male lead, who loved to act cool for no reason, to the curb.
As she fought her way forward, she realized that the rich girl who used to hate her was actually kind of cute. When she got close, the rich girl would even blush?
Jiang Xianzhi realized she didn’t hate Zhou Yining anymore. Ever since Zhou Yining came back from being sick, she’d been acting strange. She wasn’t afraid of Jiang Xianzhi anymore and sometimes said weird things that made Jiang Xianzhi’s face turn red.
So Jiang Xianzhi’s daily life became:
September 2: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 3: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 4: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red…
September 13: After more than ten days of defeat, the rich girl decided to stand up for herself!
But on September 14, she was still teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red!

      <description><![CDATA[Jiang Ci didn’t expect the iceberg she spent a passionate night with last night to be Gu Feiran, the goddess her ex admired for so long.
Her heart suddenly felt a pang of loss.
In the hospital corridor, the other noticed her.
Wearing a white mask, hands in pockets, she walked straight over, her autumn-like watery eyes staring directly.
Their eyes met.
When she got close, she turned her gaze away, looked at the person beside her, and said, “Dr. Jiang, Bed 7 can process discharge procedures.”
Last night was an accident, but since she marked her, she had to take responsibility.
Later, as their relationship grew closer, Jiang Ci felt she couldn’t hold her back and ended it.
Hearing this, the other’s cool figure paused, her eyes darkened.
She said nothing and turned to leave.
Jiang Ci thought their story was over, but one late night, driving through the streets, she unexpectedly saw the cool, proud Dr. Gu standing by the roadside, one hand on a tree, looking like she might vomit.
Jiang Ci thought, even if they couldn’t be lovers, they were at least somewhat connected strangers; checking on her wouldn’t hurt.
She pulled the car over and walked up.
No smell of alcohol—could it be a bad stomach?
Seeing her vomit so painfully, Jiang Ci blurted out, “You’re a doctor and still got a bad stomach.”
Gu Feiran’s beautiful eyes lifted slightly, her gaze like a knife, “…”

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Li Mohan was of Han blood, yet everyone in the family despised her. All she wanted was to keep her head down, endure quietly, and make it to the day she could stand on her own.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That was until the night her younger uncle, Han Yezhen, forced her down on the bed, drove his cock into her virgin body, and shattered everything. From then on, everything spiraled beyond her control.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">She tried to escape Han Yezhen’s advances, all while enduring her cousin’s bullying at school.</span>

      <description><![CDATA[Gu Yu Qi, a daughter born to a marquis household. She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky. It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.
But what happened to her in the end?
For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.
If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.
Who knew he’d be reborn again…
When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky. Just what are you playing at!?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[General Qi Ren, known as the "Mad Wolf" was once an undefeated war god. However, he was poisoned by an enemy spy on the battlefield, which left him mentally impaired, leading to the tragic downfall of a legendary hero. The Emperor, relieved to have neutralized this formidable threat to his throne, felt a twinge of guilt. Hearing rumors that the "madman" harbored affection for the timid and mute Seventh Prince, Fu Yu'an, the Emperor decided to arrange their marriage, believing it to be a benevolent gesture.  
However, after the wedding, Fu Yu'an, who had to play both father and mother to the seemingly foolish general, was shocked when he saw the "madman" climbing into his bed with clear, calculating eyes. Fu Yu'an kicked him off and exclaimed, "You're not a fool?"  
To which Qi Ren retorted, "And you're not mute, are you? We're both hiding our true selves—so why the disdain?"

      <description><![CDATA[General Qi Ren, known as the "Mad Wolf" was once an undefeated war god. However, he was poisoned by an enemy spy on the battlefield, which left him mentally impaired, leading to the tragic downfall of a legendary hero. The Emperor, relieved to have neutralized this formidable threat to his throne, felt a twinge of guilt. Hearing rumors that the "madman" harbored affection for the timid and mute Seventh Prince, Fu Yu'an, the Emperor decided to arrange their marriage, believing it to be a benevolent gesture.  
However, after the wedding, Fu Yu'an, who had to play both father and mother to the seemingly foolish general, was shocked when he saw the "madman" climbing into his bed with clear, calculating eyes. Fu Yu'an kicked him off and exclaimed, "You're not a fool?"  
To which Qi Ren retorted, "And you're not mute, are you? We're both hiding our true selves—so why the disdain?"

      <description><![CDATA["Every day, a recurring hellish dream. Junseong is stuck in a world that feels like an endless loop, much like a roguelike game. It's a cursed world where he struggles every day. Two months have passed since he set foot in the zombie apocalypse world in his dreams. "Ha...." As soon as he woke up, his gaze was instinctively drawn to the internet broadcast that he habitually left on. -A major riot is occurring in some regions due to the current situation... Then, beep! A loud sound announcing a disaster alert echoed in Junseong's head. Unconsciously picking up his phone along with the alarm sound, Junseong couldn't hide his confused expression.
[10:44 AM] It was the exact time he had always woken up in his dream. Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. "I've been wanting to ask you something."
"What?" As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo's gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. "Why do you look at me like that?" Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. "How am I... looking at you?"
"...." Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the 'fake smile' he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of blood was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of blood from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his 'clothes' but emanated from him.``]]></description>

"Like you have a leg disease. I have insomnia. Shall we help each other as patients?"
Using Seokju's insomnia as an excuse, Ajin fell asleep in his embrace, becoming accustomed to his body temperature. "I want to work at your place until I die." "Then just stay here. Here, in my room, sit on my knees. Let me bring the world to this room. But doubts keep sprouting, despite sealing the cracks of happiness."
"Ajin, you can't leave this room until you've paid off all your debts." Now, this room became Ajin's world, yet he found solace in the fact that Seokju didn't abandon him.]]></description>

"...Ah, I got it right this time? Yeah, I'll use this for my fiancé. What of it?" Ian's voice continued soothingly. "Even if I just torment him a little, that young master will run off crying to his daddy. If he's an alpha, he might even be traumatized."
In this world, is this a dream or reality? Is my fiancé now buying adult toys from my favorite club just to torment me? That sounded far more alluring and sweet than any love confession Noah had ever heard. Noah immediately changed the resolve he had just made to not marry Ian Miller. Someone who would even pluck a star from the sky for him is nothing special, and someone who hates him is nothing special either, but someone who will torment him is most welcome. This marriage must happen! It absolutely must! The delusion and love between a lovable, cute masochist and a lone, serious bad guy!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Shen Hanzhi woke up and found herself transmigrated into a novel as the villainous Alpha with the same name. The original Shen Hanzhi forced Wen Jin, a pitiful female protagonist from a fallen family, to marry her. She plundered Wen Jin’s possessions, forcibly marked her, and, after growing bored, brought a lover home to provoke the already pregnant Wen Jin.
Wen Jin lost her child and was imprisoned by Shen Hanzhi in a villa; she was completely blackened. Later, with the help of the male protagonist Liang Shuo, Wen Jin escaped the Shen family and ruined Shen Hanzhi’s reputation, leaving her as a madwoman on the streets.
Shen Hanzhi received the original novel’s plot. When she regained her senses, she was putting a wedding ring on Wen Jin’s finger. She turned to flee the wedding scene, but before she could move, her central nervous system received a shock.
Along with the shock, a strange voice echoed in her mind: The host cannot act out of character, or the villainous Alpha system will judge it as immediate death. At this, Shen Hanzhi felt completely numb!
Thus, Shen Hanzhi and Wen Jin’s daily life became like this:
Shen Hanzhi glared fiercely at Wen Jin: “You wrote my name so uglily, so you must write it ten more times as punishment!”
Shen Hanzhi stared at the delicate girl on the bed with a harsh tone: “I told you eight hundred times to eat more green peppers for nutrition, but you picked them out again!”
Wen Jin lived in a quagmire. She was an illegitimate daughter treated as a shame by the Wen family, living worse than a dog. Before leaving the Wen family at nineteen, she couldn’t even read.
A woman named Shen Hanzhi taught her to read, took her to various places to have fun, and gave her the life a person should have. Her Sister Shen was perfect in every way, except her tone sometimes sounded fierce.
But when Wen Jin watched TV, she understood it was the flirtation between wives, so she wasn’t afraid. When Wen Jin turned twenty, Shen Hanzhi finally accumulated enough villainous Alpha points to divorce the girl and live her own life.
But the girl hugged her neck and coquettishly said: “Sister, I like it when you bully me.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Zhou Yining died suddenly after 17 hours of intense work. When she woke up, she found herself transported into a romance novel, becoming the self-conscious and sensitive female lead.
The original character was a student at Nanchuan City No. 1 High School with average grades but secretly in love with the male lead, Zhang Ye. This caused the female supporting characters in the book to viciously slander her and even bully her at school. Among them, the one who hated the original character the most was the wealthy heiress Jiang Xianzhi.
After enduring persecution from her family, a series of school bullying incidents, and a physically and emotionally abusive relationship with the male lead, the original character finally achieved a happy ending with him.
Thinking about the original plot, Zhou Yining almost laughed in anger. That shitty male lead?
She didn’t care for him at all. It was her senior year, and clearly, the teachers hadn’t assigned enough homework if there was still time for this useless romantic nonsense.
Zhou Yining tore the original plot apart. She studied hard, aiming to top every subject. She rejected her family’s moral manipulation, gathered evidence to send those who bullied the original character to justice, and kicked the male lead, who loved to act cool for no reason, to the curb.
As she fought her way forward, she realized that the rich girl who used to hate her was actually kind of cute. When she got close, the rich girl would even blush?
Jiang Xianzhi realized she didn’t hate Zhou Yining anymore. Ever since Zhou Yining came back from being sick, she’d been acting strange. She wasn’t afraid of Jiang Xianzhi anymore and sometimes said weird things that made Jiang Xianzhi’s face turn red.
So Jiang Xianzhi’s daily life became:
September 2: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 3: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red.
September 4: Teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red…
September 13: After more than ten days of defeat, the rich girl decided to stand up for herself!
But on September 14, she was still teased by Zhou Yining until her face turned red!

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Li Suimei knew that Qin Qing would disdain to attend her engagement ceremony with Qin Zhan.
After all, as a vicious female supporting character, Li Suimei’s role as a stepping stone for the male and female leads was almost over.
Why would Qin Qing come to help her?
Li Suimei chuckled bitterly. She had heard rumors about Qin Qing being very protective of her loved ones, but she didn't know who had spread those rumors.
——At the engagement ceremony, Qin Qing, who was originally not supposed to attend, suddenly appeared. Wearing a snow-white wedding dress, she stood in the position that should have belonged to the male protagonist and said expressionlessly,
"Now, you are my wife."
Li Suimei: "..."
Didn't this person seem indifferent towards her just yesterday?
••••
Small Theater:
Qin Qing pinched Li Suimei's wrist, her gaze fierce, "Back then, I always thought, you invited me to dinner and movies, stayed up late with me to go through documents, hugged my arm and cried, calling me 'sister.' Whenever I got angry, you would get nervous, and you even walked in and out of my room in your pajamas. If that wasn't love, what was it?"
Li Suimei looked confused, "When did I bent?"
Qin Qing: "..."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Male Lead:</strong> <em>Kang Tae-shin</em> — owner of 4, Cheonghae-dong 118-gil. His work is as unusual as his mysterious aura.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Female Lead:</strong> <em>Woo Seula</em> — her life turned upside down after a sudden outbreak on her skin. While desperately looking for a cure, she crosses paths with Kang Taeshin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>When to Read:</strong> When you want a romantic comedy wrapped up in exorcism and fate.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Story Intro</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Woo Seula’s whole body suddenly breaks out in a rash, and no doctor can explain. After trying everything she can think of, she finally goes to see a shaman — and finds out what she has is called Mudoo.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Following the shaman’s instructions, she heads to Cheonghae-dong 118-gil 4 — and that’s where she meets a man named Kang Tae-shin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Seula, I’d like you to help me with my work.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t work at night. I’m a morning person — I need to stick to a routine and be active during the day.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Three days from now. Ten at night. Come to Cheonghae-dong.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">She thought he was just some weirdo — but after meeting him, the Mudoo clears up completely, and her body feels light again.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Except… now she’s seeing things she shouldn’t be seeing — and panic sets in.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it really that scary, seeing what’s in front of you?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“…Can’t you make it so I don’t see them again?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Just pretend you don’t see, don’t hear, don’t feel anything. Act exactly like you did before your third eye opened.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A man whose true nature is a mystery — Kang Tae-shin — and Donggil, a talking dog who claims he’s a spirit.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Living with them, Seula has no choice but to exorcise ghosts — in this strange, chilly story full of secrets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Still, if you ever get too scared… come to me.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Tonight, I’ll come pick you up.”</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[To survive, Sheng Nuan must traverse different worlds, playing the role of self-destructive cannon fodder while saving the darkest villains. These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand. Holding the cannon fodder's script, Sheng Nuan is terrified...
Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...
