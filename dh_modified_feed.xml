      <description><![CDATA[Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.
After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor's chest: "Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?"
The new emperor kissed her: "You will be fine, just love me."
The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: "Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left."
When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess's obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official's wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.
Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.
------
The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.
Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.
For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, "The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated," before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. Blood poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.
When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.
Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: "Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?"
"... She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore."
Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: "She said she won't fight, so the fight is over?"

The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."

      <title>The White Moonlight Disdained by the Male Protagonist of Redemption</title>
      <volume/>
      <chaptername>Chapter 14.2</chaptername>
      <nameextend>***Ning Yao opened her mouth and asked directly, "Why..."***</nameextend>
      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/the-white-moonlight-disdained-by-the-male-protagonist-of-redemption/chapter-14-2/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao died tragically.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The man she had saved and cared for for many years despised her and shattered her spirit veins with his own hands and dissolved her body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. I have waited for this day.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan's ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And Ning Yao's lifelong wish is to ascend.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft—those fools don’t know his worth. He’s from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it works, great. If not… well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions. When that happens, their instincts will turn against their beloved, giving rise to an uncontrollable urge to kill.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slay one’s beloved, attain enlightenment, ascend immediately, and forget the past.</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfect outcome for both.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao knew that Feng Jingzhuo had already begun to grow his heart’s scales.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, he endured the agonizing pain, hiding away to claw open his own chest. He ripped out the endlessly growing scales, pinned his own hands down with bone nails—desperately resisting his dragon instincts.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I beg you… whatever you do, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’ll be over soon. Be good. Stay outside…”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside, Ning Yao pondered, if</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we can both ascend, that’s better than neither of us ascending at all.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, she went in.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as she always did, she held him in her arms, kissing his trembling, pale lips with tenderness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After many 10 thousand years, Ning Yao was reborn and successfully ascended.</span>
She forgot Feng Jingzhou, but he remembered her.
Tormenting himself, he wanted to turn back time.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao was very happy, but the ceremony of conferring the gods was a little simple.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the entire world of gods was busy trying to stop a fallen god who wants to activate the forbidden Time-Reversal Array.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Theme: My heart is controlled by me, not by heavens.</span>

      <description><![CDATA[The man I had a drunken one-night stand with turned out to be the male lead from the original story. The issue? This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.

      <title>Transmigrating Before The Crazy Beauty Scum A Loses Control</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Summary 1:
"Even if it's a one-for-one trade, I will take over his company."
These were the last words Luan Yenan said before transmigrating into a book.
As the sole head of a Fortune 500 investment company, she never expected her end to be dying from overwork after three sleepless days and nights, only to transmigrate into a novel.
The character she transmigrated into was a crazy, abusive Alpha who tormented the female lead before having her glands removed by the seemingly innocent but secretly cunning female lead.
Crazy? Perfect, I’m crazy too.
Abusive Alpha? Sorry, I’m single and not interested.
As for the female lead, are you talking about the little girl I’ve pinned down, teary-eyed and begging for mercy?
Seemingly innocent but secretly cunning? Interesting.
Let me personally train her. I want to see how she plans to cut out my glands.
Summary 2:
Zuo Baixuan, who had just differentiated into an Omega, was sold by her adoptive parents to a crazy, abusive Alpha. She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.
Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, "I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early."
After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.
One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: "I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce."
Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: "I’ve already graduated."
"So?"
"I want to have a child. With you."
Let’s see who’s really the crazy one.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[At the princess's banquet, in a secluded hall, Helan Ci pressed her palm against the wall, encountering the equally disheveled newly crowned top scholar Lu Wuyou. One was as delicate as a willow, the other had a flushed face.
Their eyes met, and in each other's gaze, they saw a glimmer of despair.
"I'll go first..."
"I'll head that way..."
However, what was even more despairing was the sound of the princess's maid and the second prince's attendant searching for them not far away.
Helan Ci bit her lip: "What don't you just go to the princess?"
Lu Wuyou endured: "I think the second prince is not bad either."
Helan Ci: "If we keep talking, we'll only end up hurting each other!"
Lu Wuyou closed his eyes: "Then let it be a mutual destruction."
Helan Ci: "…?"
A night later, their innocence was lost, and they were forced into marriage. Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband's demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.
Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”
Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to. Who told me to marry you— I’m going to be a powerful minister. I can’t fall here.”
Helan Ci, “Then do your best! I’m counting on you!”
Lu Wuyou, “…?”
Years later, Lu Wuyou became the Prime Minister, holding the highest position among officials, wielding immense power across the land, and reflecting on the past.
A student asked him how he had come this far.
Prime Minister Lu thought to himself that as long as one marries a wife of extraordinary beauty, often coveted by others, it would always inspire one to strive to make progress.

      <title>Mistakenly Treated The Princess As A Concubine</title>

      <description><![CDATA[After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing'an Marquis's residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle's family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke's residence was snatched away by her stepsister.
After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.
The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.
This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.
The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.
To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.
However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.
When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.
The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.
It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.
She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.
While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.
Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!
————
At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.
At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.
The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.
Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.
And all the girl asked for in return was—
"Sister, kiss me."
"Sister, hug me."
"Sister, cuddle me."
The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.
Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl's "concubine" while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.
————
Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.
Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.
“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”
Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—]]></description>

      <title>Giving Interstellar Players a Horror Ghost Game Shock</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!
What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!
With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!
She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”
She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”
She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”
Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”
Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”

      <title>The Male Lead's Harem Belongs to Me (GL)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Jiang Han died from staying up too late reading a novel, and after her death, she found herself transported into the ancient melodramatic romance novel she had been reading.
The male lead is a cold and domineering prince, and the female lead is the prince's long-cherished "white moonlight". Unfortunately, the white moonlight has a lowly status, and the prince's mother disapproves. The male lead goes to great lengths, enduring countless melodramatic events, heart-wrenching and physically exhausting, ultimately winning the heart of his beloved and achieving a happy ending. And Jiang Han is one of the cannon fodder female characters who, out of jealousy, targeted the male lead's white moonlight.
Jiang Han, who traveled through time, said: "No way, I just want to be a salted fish and play mahjong every day."
So when the male lead said: "I want to marry my white moonlight."
Jiang Han: Marry! You must marry! The gifts are all ready.
The male lead said: "She is timid and frail. As the princess, you should take good care of her."
Jiang Han: Take care! Must take care of !Tomorrow, I'll have her live next to me!
The male lead said: "She's too considerate. She won't speak up about her needs, so you should be more accommodating to her."
Jiang Han: Move! Must yield! Tomorrow, I will divorce you and give the title of princess to her!
••••
The next day, Jiang Han indeed handed him a divorce letter. The male lead, feeling complicated, signed it, but Jiang Han happily prepared to leave. Just as she reached the gate of the mansion, a group of concubines led by White Moonlight blocked her way.
White Moonlight: Sister Jiang, don't go. Would you stay?
A group of concubines: Yeah, yeah, please don't leave.
Jiang Han showed a troubled expression, and the male lead's heart was filled with joy. Just as he was about to say a few words of persuasion, he saw Jiang Han decisively shake her head.
The male lead thought it was a pity. Before he could catch his breath, he saw the person he held dear, his "white moonlight," take out a divorce agreement and coldly say to him, "Sign it. I want to leave with Sister Jiang."
The male lead stared wide-eyed in disbelief, a mouthful of old blood choked in his chest. However, the next moment, his group of concubines gritted their teeth and said to White Moonlight: "Weiwei, you are being too ungrateful. Why did you prepare the divorce papers all by yourself without telling us?"
#My harem seems to have turned into my princess's, what should I do#
#Is it too late to regret now#
••••
One-on-one [highlight this], before the divorce, they were just pure revolutionary comrades and good friends. After the divorce, there will be romantic developments.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Synopsis: </span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin Yuran never would have thought that the client sitting across from her, forcing them both to work together, was the high school classmate she had rejected long ago, Chi Ye.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two maintained a distant yet courteous relationship, keeping their distance as they worked together.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Lin Yuran gradually felt something wasn't quite right.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, why did this man insist on her working at his company instead of her own studio? And moreover, how come her office just so happened to be directly opposite his?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another instance, when Lin Yuran accepted a ride in another man's Rolls-Royce Phantom, Chi Ye only sighed, "I thought I'd never get to ride a luxury car like this in my life."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The very next day, Chi Ye's car changed to a Bentley, then Bugatti, followed by Koenigsegg... Another time, Lin Yuran accidentally stumbled upon Chi Ye's Baidu profile and discovered that her favorite lollipop factory was registered under his name.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But rumor had it that the factory closed five years ago, and that some mysterious big shot loved eating these lollipops, so he bought the factory and continued production regardless of profit or loss, no matter what the situation.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous clues led Lin Yuran to suspect—</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chi Ye still liked her?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Little did she know, even their second encounter was part of his plan.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Chi Ye remained unaware that on that sweltering afternoon six years ago, Lin Yuran had quietly watched his lonely figure from afar and murmured softly, "If we meet again someday, I hope I can respond to you."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, only the wind heard her confession.</span>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the tender age of five, Shen Guiyan could recite the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thousand Character Classic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from memory; at the age of six, she could already play guqin and even composed her own melodies; at the age of seven, she could write a full poem and finish it in the brief time it took for the incense stick to burn; and by the time she turned eight, she was already betrothed to the son of the Prime Minister.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone said that she was born with Phoenix Jade* in her mouth— destined for greatness from the very start.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, fate took a cruel turn.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A woman from the modern era arrived and transformed Shen Guiyan’s once-brash younger sister into someone sharp and clever. She stole her fiancé, harmed her birth mother, and ruthlessly pulled her down from the heavens. Laughing arrogantly, she sneered, “How can a mere woman from the feudal era ever compete with a modern woman of the 21st century?”</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Schemes and trickery altered her predestined fate, a pregnant belly destroyed her marriage prospects, and she was forced to marry a spoiled and troublemaking son of a noble, who brought ruin upon her on her supposed wedding night. And yet,  by some strange twist of fate, it inadvertently led her to the most extraordinary encounter with her fated one.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A crazy monk once read her fortune: a great calamity at the coming of age, a great joy at the age of twenty, and a great sorrow in old age.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Shen Guiyan did not believe in fate. She only believed that with human determination, one could even overcome destiny.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who took from her, she would make sure they would pay! Those who harmed her, she would make sure they would burn in the pits of hell! </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So what if you have traveled through time? So what if you have been reborn?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you have eight or ten golden fingers**, I would chop them all up for you!</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I would be coming for you, no matter what!</span>
&nbsp;
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">*born with Phoenix Jade in her mouth - this symbolizes a noble or auspicious birth, often implying destiny, luck, or even divine favor.</span></i>

      <description><![CDATA[General Qi Ren, known as the "Mad Wolf" was once an undefeated war god. However, he was poisoned by an enemy spy on the battlefield, which left him mentally impaired, leading to the tragic downfall of a legendary hero. The Emperor, relieved to have neutralized this formidable threat to his throne, felt a twinge of guilt. Hearing rumors that the "madman" harbored affection for the timid and mute Seventh Prince, Fu Yu'an, the Emperor decided to arrange their marriage, believing it to be a benevolent gesture.  
However, after the wedding, Fu Yu'an, who had to play both father and mother to the seemingly foolish general, was shocked when he saw the "madman" climbing into his bed with clear, calculating eyes. Fu Yu'an kicked him off and exclaimed, "You're not a fool?"  
To which Qi Ren retorted, "And you're not mute, are you? We're both hiding our true selves—so why the disdain?"

Holding the cannon fodder's script, Sheng Nuan is terrified...
Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

She was a straight woman, crossed into a porn game she played years ago.
She wondered why the hell it was a modified version.
Did it want to drive her mad?
——
Wei Qing calmed her mood and often looked at the obedient cute girl with loving eyes.
She nodded satisfactorily—she was a good child.
Wei Qing drank the water the girl handed her without caution.
She went to bed and felt especially sleepy today.
She grew somewhat drowsy...
——
<em>Today’s dream... why was it especially real?</em>
The girl was completely naked; she straddled her waist.

In her past life, the empress bestowed upon her a wife, the princess of a fallen kingdom. However, when the crown prince attempted to assault her wife, he was killed in self-defense.

      <description><![CDATA[A light-hearted, humorous, face-slapping, satisfying read.
A quirky and clever Alpha × a cold, black lotus Omega.
Jiang Ci transmigrated into the role of a cannon-fodder villain in an ancient ABO novel.
The original body, a prestigious first-rank military marquis with illustrious battle achievements, married the female lead out of lust for her beauty.
After marriage, his true nature was revealed: he imprisoned and abused her, and as a womanizer, he filled his courtyard with concubines, favoring them over his wife... In the end, he was mutilated by the blackened princess, who removed his gland, severed his limbs, and locked him in a pitch-dark dungeon.
When Jiang Ci transmigrated, she found herself straddling the female lead, engaged in unspeakable acts.
Jiang Ci immediately revealed her true self: "I'm not Gao Yi! I won't take the blame for this! I can even prove it by breakdancing!"
Female lead: "???"
The system issued a task: "Please fix the messed-up plot, torment the female lead, and promote her descent into darkness."
Jiang Ci: "No time for you."
System: "???"
…
Jiang Ci had been single for over twenty years and had only ever liked one fictional character.
Now that she had transmigrated into her lord, how could she not seize this heaven-sent opportunity?
No matter who you are, she would confront heaven and earth, and teach a lesson to anyone who bullied the female lead!
After all, she had become the villain—it would be a shame not to act domineering and arrogant!
She gave her all to the female lead, protecting her at every turn, helping her build her career, and imparting all her skills... Only to eventually realize that she was just a substitute, that the female lead had always harbored a white moonlight in her heart.
All the ambiguity between them was because she resembled that person.
Jiang Ci: "Can I know who she is?"
Female lead: "No."
Jiang Ci was finally numb. Heartbroken and disillusioned, she exchanged rewards with the system and returned to her original world.
…
Later, the woman who had ascended to the pinnacle of power got drunk at a palace banquet. "Have you found her?"
Maid: "Your Highness has forgotten, she was a soul transmigrator, not belonging to this world. We don't even know her real name."
The wine cup fell to the ground, and the woman's eyes dimmed.
…
When Jiang Ci woke up again, she found herself still in the novel, but now she had transmigrated into her own body, and ten years had passed.
The young girl she once needed to protect had now become the powerful and influential Grand Princess. It was said that this Grand Princess was cold and aloof, with her only peculiar hobby being to capture those with eccentric personalities and suspected of having delusions.
Jiang Ci wanted nothing to do with the Grand Princess this time and tried her best to keep her identity hidden.
However, the Grand Princess, after ten years, had thoroughly studied all of Jiang Ci's tactics, surpassing her teacher and excelling even further.

After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor's chest: "Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?"
The new emperor kissed her: "You will be fine, just love me."
The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: "Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left."
When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess's obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official's wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.
Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.
------
The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.
Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.
For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, "The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated," before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. Blood poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.
When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.
Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: "Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?"
"... She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore."
Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: "She said she won't fight, so the fight is over?"

      <title>The White Moonlight Disdained by the Male Protagonist of Redemption</title>

      <nameextend>***Ning Yao opened her mouth and asked directly, "Why..."***</nameextend>
      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/the-white-moonlight-disdained-by-the-male-protagonist-of-redemption/chapter-14-1/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao died tragically.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The man she had saved and cared for for many years despised her and shattered her spirit veins with his own hands and dissolved her body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. I have waited for this day.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan's ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And Ning Yao's lifelong wish is to ascend.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft—those fools don’t know his worth. He’s from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it works, great. If not… well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions. When that happens, their instincts will turn against their beloved, giving rise to an uncontrollable urge to kill.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slay one’s beloved, attain enlightenment, ascend immediately, and forget the past.</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfect outcome for both.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao knew that Feng Jingzhuo had already begun to grow his heart’s scales.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, he endured the agonizing pain, hiding away to claw open his own chest. He ripped out the endlessly growing scales, pinned his own hands down with bone nails—desperately resisting his dragon instincts.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I beg you… whatever you do, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’ll be over soon. Be good. Stay outside…”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside, Ning Yao pondered, if</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we can both ascend, that’s better than neither of us ascending at all.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, she went in.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as she always did, she held him in her arms, kissing his trembling, pale lips with tenderness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After many 10 thousand years, Ning Yao was reborn and successfully ascended.</span>
She forgot Feng Jingzhou, but he remembered her.
Tormenting himself, he wanted to turn back time.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao was very happy, but the ceremony of conferring the gods was a little simple.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the entire world of gods was busy trying to stop a fallen god who wants to activate the forbidden Time-Reversal Array.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Theme: My heart is controlled by me, not by heavens.</span>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Synopsis: </span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin Yuran never would have thought that the client sitting across from her, forcing them both to work together, was the high school classmate she had rejected long ago, Chi Ye.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two maintained a distant yet courteous relationship, keeping their distance as they worked together.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Lin Yuran gradually felt something wasn't quite right.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, why did this man insist on her working at his company instead of her own studio? And moreover, how come her office just so happened to be directly opposite his?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another instance, when Lin Yuran accepted a ride in another man's Rolls-Royce Phantom, Chi Ye only sighed, "I thought I'd never get to ride a luxury car like this in my life."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The very next day, Chi Ye's car changed to a Bentley, then Bugatti, followed by Koenigsegg... Another time, Lin Yuran accidentally stumbled upon Chi Ye's Baidu profile and discovered that her favorite lollipop factory was registered under his name.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But rumor had it that the factory closed five years ago, and that some mysterious big shot loved eating these lollipops, so he bought the factory and continued production regardless of profit or loss, no matter what the situation.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous clues led Lin Yuran to suspect—</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chi Ye still liked her?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Little did she know, even their second encounter was part of his plan.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Chi Ye remained unaware that on that sweltering afternoon six years ago, Lin Yuran had quietly watched his lonely figure from afar and murmured softly, "If we meet again someday, I hope I can respond to you."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, only the wind heard her confession.</span>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In the book, she is a useless person from a poor family. Because she is easy to control, Lu Zijin chooses her to be the redundant Alpha of the Lu family.
Originally, she could have just enjoyed the easy life provided, but she gradually became greedy. She not only covets the Lu family’s wealth but also wants to make the female lead, Lu Zijin, submit to her. She tries to harm Lu Zijin several times, but each attempt is exposed. In the end, Lu Zijin and her childhood friend break both of Wei Lan’s legs and throw her out of the Lu family.
A few days later, she dies.
Wei Lan frowns as she looks at the original book’s content: Is the easy life not good enough, or is jade not worth carving? Why would you go and provoke the female lead for no reason?
Learning her lesson, Wei Lan strictly follows the rules Lu Zijin sets for her, never crossing the line or actively seeking Lu Zijin’s attention. She rarely goes out, always holding a few unremarkable stones that she carves.
At first, Lu Zijin finds this redundant Alpha well-behaved. She only allows Wei Lan to share her bed during the heat period and sends her away afterward. Wei Lan never complains.
But gradually, Lu Zijin feels differently about this redundant Alpha. Even after the heat period, she enjoys being around Wei Lan. However, Wei Lan always declines because of the few rough stones she carries, making Lu Zijin dislike those stones.
Over the past year, the most popular jade carver in the Great Zhou Dynasty is Qing Lan. This carver is extremely mysterious, rarely appearing in public. Even when she does, she wears a mask and a wide black hooded cloak, hiding her face.
Her carvings are highly sought after and fetch high prices.
One evening, the so-called redundant Alpha who lives off others returns. Wei Lan holds a stack of silver notes, her eyes sparkling as she looks at Lu Zijin: “Wife, I sold my carved ornaments for a good price again.”
Lu Zijin looks at Wei Lan with gentle eyes: “Good job, very obedient. There’ll be a reward later.”

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Qing wakes up to find herself transported into an ancient famine novel, becoming a shameless rogue. During a famine, the original host scams food and drink in the city, committing all sorts of evil deeds. With an innocent and harmless face, she tricks the distressed Jiang Jinhuang into marrying her. After the marriage, the original host’s true nature is revealed. When Jiang Jinhuang refuses to consummate the marriage, the host relentlessly pressures and torments her, even nearly strangling Jiang Jinhuang’s younger sister to death. After enduring countless hardships, Jiang Jinhuang finally returns to the capital, where her family and childhood friend deal with the original host, whose final destination is a mass grave outside the city.
Ye Qing, having received the entire plot, plans to stay far away from Jiang Jinhuang and live well in this ancient world. But just as she prepares to leave, her personal system activates, unlocking the spatial ability from her previous life. Unlike before, her space now includes land and a spiritual spring. The system tells her that by earning Jiang Jinhuang’s favor, she can gain rewards to ensure she won’t starve during the famine.
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 potato seeds;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with a 2-pound carp;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 eggs…
Through her efforts, Ye Qing helps Jiang Jinhuang and her sister thrive during the famine. When she successfully escorts Jiang Jinhuang back to the capital and prepares to leave alone, Jiang Jinhuang’s eyes redden with tears.
Jiang Jinhuang, the daughter of the Minister of Rites, is separated from her family during a visit to Linzhou when they are scattered by rioters. After many struggles, she reaches Linzhou but fails to find her relatives. Lost and desperate, she believes Ye Qing’s words and temporarily marries her. However, after the marriage, Ye Qing becomes a different person, constantly abusing her. Then, one day, Ye Qing suddenly changes for the better, protecting Jiang Jinhuang and her sister, ensuring they never go hungry. Later, Ye Qing even escorts them back to the capital. When Ye Qing tries to leave, Jiang Jinhuang blocks the door, her fox-like eyes staring at Ye Qing with an unreadable expression, saying, “Where do you think you’re going, abandoning me?”

      <description><![CDATA[When Yu Jing was 19 years old, she still hadn’t differentiated, but it didn’t affect her image as a beautiful and strong Alpha in the eyes of her fans.
Three years after her debut, she won over a huge group of loyal fans while somehow gaining an enemy—actress Ming Zhu, known as the queen of ratings.
Ming Zhu was an Alpha; sheclashed with Yu Jing at an event, and Yu Jing thought they’d never cross paths again. But, by some twist of fate, they were invited to the same reality show.
Before filming even started, their fans were already tearing each other apart on Weibo.
Yu Jing couldn’t resist checking the comments and got angrier the more she read.
She could accept being called a has-been, and she could tolerate accusations of riding Ming Zhu’s fame. But someone dared question her gender, saying she’d definitely differentiate as an Omega???
Yu Jing suppressed the urge to jump into the fray, secretly swearing: Once I differentiate into a top-tier Alpha, I’ll crush all you haters and your idol into the ground!
Then she differentiated into a delicate Omega.
And got pinned against the wall by Ming Zhu.
In an intimate room—
Ming Zhu’s fingers brushed over the fragile skin hiding her gland, looking down at the person in her arms, her tone soft: “Are you okay?”
Yu Jing’s hands weakly clung to her neck, her cheeks flushed, her voice soft and pleading:
“Mark me already, please.”

<strong>Warnings:</strong>
1. Lots of original world-building, Alphas don’t have male anatomy.
2. Melodramatic plot, slow-burn romance, proceed with caution if it’s not your thing.

      <title>Dressed as the Scumbag Alpha Mom of the Tragic Female Lead (ABO, GL)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[What made Jiang Chuxie collapse even more than transmigrating into a blood-type novel was that she became the scumbag Alpha dad of the book’s female lead… or rather, mom?
The scumbag Alpha mom relied on the female lead’s mother, Gu Lingjun, to rise to wealth and prominence. She teamed up with her mistress to kill the original wife and seize the family fortune that should have belonged to the female lead, setting the stage for the female lead’s tragic life.
As for the ending, this scumbag Alpha naturally didn’t fare well either. She was ultimately ruined by her daughter’s six Alphas, left with a shattered family and no place to be buried.
Jiang Chuxie had no desire to follow in the original body’s footsteps. She didn’t want to be a scumbag, nor did she want to be killed. She just wanted to live peacefully… Wait, why does the person sleeping beside her look so much like… Gu Lingjun?
Jiang Chuxie couldn’t escape the fate of an ABO novel. Forced to marry due to pregnancy and reluctantly accepting her fate, the gentle Omega, who had always been submissive, suddenly changed drastically. She broke up, threw money at her, and ran off pregnant, turning the tables and making Jiang Chuxie the one who got played.
Jiang Chuxie: Wait, isn’t something off with this plot?
Gu Lingjun: If it’s off, that’s just right.

      <title>After Transmigrating Into a Book, I Was Forced to Play the Role of a Scumbag Alpha (GL)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Shen Hanzhi woke up and found herself transmigrated into a novel as the villainous Alpha with the same name. The original Shen Hanzhi forced Wen Jin, a pitiful female protagonist from a fallen family, to marry her. She plundered Wen Jin’s possessions, forcibly marked her, and, after growing bored, brought a lover home to provoke the already pregnant Wen Jin.
Wen Jin lost her child and was imprisoned by Shen Hanzhi in a villa; she was completely blackened. Later, with the help of the male protagonist Liang Shuo, Wen Jin escaped the Shen family and ruined Shen Hanzhi’s reputation, leaving her as a madwoman on the streets.
Shen Hanzhi received the original novel’s plot. When she regained her senses, she was putting a wedding ring on Wen Jin’s finger. She turned to flee the wedding scene, but before she could move, her central nervous system received a shock.
Along with the shock, a strange voice echoed in her mind: The host cannot act out of character, or the villainous Alpha system will judge it as immediate death. At this, Shen Hanzhi felt completely numb!
Thus, Shen Hanzhi and Wen Jin’s daily life became like this:
Shen Hanzhi glared fiercely at Wen Jin: “You wrote my name so uglily, so you must write it ten more times as punishment!”
Shen Hanzhi stared at the delicate girl on the bed with a harsh tone: “I told you eight hundred times to eat more green peppers for nutrition, but you picked them out again!”
Wen Jin lived in a quagmire. She was an illegitimate daughter treated as a shame by the Wen family, living worse than a dog. Before leaving the Wen family at nineteen, she couldn’t even read.
A woman named Shen Hanzhi taught her to read, took her to various places to have fun, and gave her the life a person should have. Her Sister Shen was perfect in every way, except her tone sometimes sounded fierce.
But when Wen Jin watched TV, she understood it was the flirtation between wives, so she wasn’t afraid. When Wen Jin turned twenty, Shen Hanzhi finally accumulated enough villainous Alpha points to divorce the girl and live her own life.
But the girl hugged her neck and coquettishly said: “Sister, I like it when you bully me.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Yu Heyi received a wedding invitation from the Omega she had secretly loved for years, she was lying in a hospital bed.
She got into a car accident during a race and had to retire.
Under the double blow, Yu Heyi accepted her mom’s suggestion.
Going on a blind date.
Her mom praised the other person like crazy, saying they were a perfect Omega, beautiful and soft and gentle.
Then…
She found out the blind date was her most hated person, no one else came close!
Her love rival—Chi Ruixi.
She still hadn’t figured out how her beta love rival turned into an Omega.
And on the day of the blind date, she marked her.
It was Chi Ruixi, crying and begging her to mark her…
Afterward, Yu Heyi said three things.
“I’ll take responsibility, I’ll fulfill an Alpha’s duties.”
“I’ll treat you well, I’ll be considerate.”
“But don’t expect love.”
Chi Ruixi heard this, gave a slight smile, and said, “No need.”
Jobless Yu Heyi was arranged by her mom to work as a chef in the cafeteria of XX Middle School.
She found out the gentle and delicate literature teacher was—Chi Ruixi?
But Chi Ruixi’s cold words made her feel weird, a bit uncomfortable.
Yu Heyi thought it was pheromones that drew her to Chi Ruixi, otherwise why would she find
Chi Ruixi, the bridesmaid at the wedding, way more charming than the bride she’d loved for years.
Then, in a daze, she permanently marked Chi Ruixi.
Chi Ruixi kept waiting for that dumb Alpha to admit she loved her, but her dumb Alpha was truly dumb.

      <description><![CDATA[The man I had a drunken one-night stand with turned out to be the male lead from the original story. The issue? This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.
No! I don't want you to express it with your body either!]]></description>

      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/giving-interstellar-players-a-horror-ghost-game-shock/chapter-91/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!
What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!
With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!
She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”
She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”
She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”
Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”
Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”

      <description><![CDATA[Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.
Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.
Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.
Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.
The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…
The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.
That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.
<hr />
Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.
Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.
At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.
He could smile, she realised, but not for her.
From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.
Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.
<hr />
After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.
But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.
On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”
Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”
Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.
For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[General Qi Ren, known as the "Mad Wolf" was once an undefeated war god. However, he was poisoned by an enemy spy on the battlefield, which left him mentally impaired, leading to the tragic downfall of a legendary hero. The Emperor, relieved to have neutralized this formidable threat to his throne, felt a twinge of guilt. Hearing rumors that the "madman" harbored affection for the timid and mute Seventh Prince, Fu Yu'an, the Emperor decided to arrange their marriage, believing it to be a benevolent gesture.  
However, after the wedding, Fu Yu'an, who had to play both father and mother to the seemingly foolish general, was shocked when he saw the "madman" climbing into his bed with clear, calculating eyes. Fu Yu'an kicked him off and exclaimed, "You're not a fool?"  
To which Qi Ren retorted, "And you're not mute, are you? We're both hiding our true selves—so why the disdain?"

The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"

&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin Yuran never would have thought that the client sitting across from her, forcing them both to work together, was the high school classmate she had rejected long ago, Chi Ye.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two maintained a distant yet courteous relationship, keeping their distance as they worked together.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Lin Yuran gradually felt something wasn't quite right.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, why did this man insist on her working at his company instead of her own studio? And moreover, how come her office just so happened to be directly opposite his?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another instance, when Lin Yuran accepted a ride in another man's Rolls-Royce Phantom, Chi Ye only sighed, "I thought I'd never get to ride a luxury car like this in my life."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The very next day, Chi Ye's car changed to a Bentley, then Bugatti, followed by Koenigsegg... Another time, Lin Yuran accidentally stumbled upon Chi Ye's Baidu profile and discovered that her favorite lollipop factory was registered under his name.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But rumor had it that the factory closed five years ago, and that some mysterious big shot loved eating these lollipops, so he bought the factory and continued production regardless of profit or loss, no matter what the situation.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous clues led Lin Yuran to suspect—</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chi Ye still liked her?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Little did she know, even their second encounter was part of his plan.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Chi Ye remained unaware that on that sweltering afternoon six years ago, Lin Yuran had quietly watched his lonely figure from afar and murmured softly, "If we meet again someday, I hope I can respond to you."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, only the wind heard her confession.</span>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing'an Marquis's residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle's family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke's residence was snatched away by her stepsister.
After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.
The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.
This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.
The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.
To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.
However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.
When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.
The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.
It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.
She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.
While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.
Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!
————
At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.
At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.
The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.
Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.
And all the girl asked for in return was—
"Sister, kiss me."
"Sister, hug me."
"Sister, cuddle me."
The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.
Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl's "concubine" while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.
————
Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.
Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.
“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”
Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—]]></description>

It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.
But what happened to her in the end?
For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.
If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.
Who knew he’d be reborn again…

      <description><![CDATA[To survive, Sheng Nuan must traverse different worlds, playing the role of self-destructive cannon fodder while saving the darkest villains. These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand. Holding the cannon fodder's script, Sheng Nuan is terrified...
Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

      <title>Transmigrating Before The Crazy Beauty Scum A Loses Control</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Summary 1:
"Even if it's a one-for-one trade, I will take over his company."
These were the last words Luan Yenan said before transmigrating into a book.
As the sole head of a Fortune 500 investment company, she never expected her end to be dying from overwork after three sleepless days and nights, only to transmigrate into a novel.
The character she transmigrated into was a crazy, abusive Alpha who tormented the female lead before having her glands removed by the seemingly innocent but secretly cunning female lead.
Crazy? Perfect, I’m crazy too.
Abusive Alpha? Sorry, I’m single and not interested.
As for the female lead, are you talking about the little girl I’ve pinned down, teary-eyed and begging for mercy?
Seemingly innocent but secretly cunning? Interesting.
Let me personally train her. I want to see how she plans to cut out my glands.
Summary 2:
Zuo Baixuan, who had just differentiated into an Omega, was sold by her adoptive parents to a crazy, abusive Alpha. She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.
Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, "I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early."
After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.
One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: "I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce."
Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: "I’ve already graduated."
"So?"
"I want to have a child. With you."
Let’s see who’s really the crazy one.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[In the book, she is a useless person from a poor family. Because she is easy to control, Lu Zijin chooses her to be the redundant Alpha of the Lu family.
Originally, she could have just enjoyed the easy life provided, but she gradually became greedy. She not only covets the Lu family’s wealth but also wants to make the female lead, Lu Zijin, submit to her. She tries to harm Lu Zijin several times, but each attempt is exposed. In the end, Lu Zijin and her childhood friend break both of Wei Lan’s legs and throw her out of the Lu family.
A few days later, she dies.
Wei Lan frowns as she looks at the original book’s content: Is the easy life not good enough, or is jade not worth carving? Why would you go and provoke the female lead for no reason?
Learning her lesson, Wei Lan strictly follows the rules Lu Zijin sets for her, never crossing the line or actively seeking Lu Zijin’s attention. She rarely goes out, always holding a few unremarkable stones that she carves.
At first, Lu Zijin finds this redundant Alpha well-behaved. She only allows Wei Lan to share her bed during the heat period and sends her away afterward. Wei Lan never complains.
But gradually, Lu Zijin feels differently about this redundant Alpha. Even after the heat period, she enjoys being around Wei Lan. However, Wei Lan always declines because of the few rough stones she carries, making Lu Zijin dislike those stones.
Over the past year, the most popular jade carver in the Great Zhou Dynasty is Qing Lan. This carver is extremely mysterious, rarely appearing in public. Even when she does, she wears a mask and a wide black hooded cloak, hiding her face.
Her carvings are highly sought after and fetch high prices.
One evening, the so-called redundant Alpha who lives off others returns. Wei Lan holds a stack of silver notes, her eyes sparkling as she looks at Lu Zijin: “Wife, I sold my carved ornaments for a good price again.”
Lu Zijin looks at Wei Lan with gentle eyes: “Good job, very obedient. There’ll be a reward later.”

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Qing wakes up to find herself transported into an ancient famine novel, becoming a shameless rogue. During a famine, the original host scams food and drink in the city, committing all sorts of evil deeds. With an innocent and harmless face, she tricks the distressed Jiang Jinhuang into marrying her. After the marriage, the original host’s true nature is revealed. When Jiang Jinhuang refuses to consummate the marriage, the host relentlessly pressures and torments her, even nearly strangling Jiang Jinhuang’s younger sister to death. After enduring countless hardships, Jiang Jinhuang finally returns to the capital, where her family and childhood friend deal with the original host, whose final destination is a mass grave outside the city.
Ye Qing, having received the entire plot, plans to stay far away from Jiang Jinhuang and live well in this ancient world. But just as she prepares to leave, her personal system activates, unlocking the spatial ability from her previous life. Unlike before, her space now includes land and a spiritual spring. The system tells her that by earning Jiang Jinhuang’s favor, she can gain rewards to ensure she won’t starve during the famine.
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 potato seeds;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with a 2-pound carp;
Jiang Jinhuang’s favor +1, rewarded with 10 eggs…
Through her efforts, Ye Qing helps Jiang Jinhuang and her sister thrive during the famine. When she successfully escorts Jiang Jinhuang back to the capital and prepares to leave alone, Jiang Jinhuang’s eyes redden with tears.
Jiang Jinhuang, the daughter of the Minister of Rites, is separated from her family during a visit to Linzhou when they are scattered by rioters. After many struggles, she reaches Linzhou but fails to find her relatives. Lost and desperate, she believes Ye Qing’s words and temporarily marries her. However, after the marriage, Ye Qing becomes a different person, constantly abusing her. Then, one day, Ye Qing suddenly changes for the better, protecting Jiang Jinhuang and her sister, ensuring they never go hungry. Later, Ye Qing even escorts them back to the capital. When Ye Qing tries to leave, Jiang Jinhuang blocks the door, her fox-like eyes staring at Ye Qing with an unreadable expression, saying, “Where do you think you’re going, abandoning me?”

      <description><![CDATA[At the princess's banquet, in a secluded hall, Helan Ci pressed her palm against the wall, encountering the equally disheveled newly crowned top scholar Lu Wuyou. One was as delicate as a willow, the other had a flushed face.
Their eyes met, and in each other's gaze, they saw a glimmer of despair.
"I'll go first..."
"I'll head that way..."
However, what was even more despairing was the sound of the princess's maid and the second prince's attendant searching for them not far away.
Helan Ci bit her lip: "What don't you just go to the princess?"
Lu Wuyou endured: "I think the second prince is not bad either."
Helan Ci: "If we keep talking, we'll only end up hurting each other!"
Lu Wuyou closed his eyes: "Then let it be a mutual destruction."
Helan Ci: "…?"
A night later, their innocence was lost, and they were forced into marriage. Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband's demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.
Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”
Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to. Who told me to marry you— I’m going to be a powerful minister. I can’t fall here.”
Helan Ci, “Then do your best! I’m counting on you!”
Lu Wuyou, “…?”
Years later, Lu Wuyou became the Prime Minister, holding the highest position among officials, wielding immense power across the land, and reflecting on the past.
A student asked him how he had come this far.
Prime Minister Lu thought to himself that as long as one marries a wife of extraordinary beauty, often coveted by others, it would always inspire one to strive to make progress.

Han's simple daily life working part-time at a convenience store is suddenly turned upside down.
"Your debt amounts to a total of one hundred million and seven thousand."
With a timid and fearful personality, Han is unwittingly drawn into the world of the 'Tasenda' club to repay the massive debt he incurred. There, he meets Jang Taesin, a man who is a perfect fit for the depths of darkness.
From the moment Taesin laid eyes on Han, he was inexplicably drawn to him and began to obsessively pursue him, offering a proposal to keep him from escaping.
"I'll stay by your side only until I get tired of you. Once I'm tired of your body, I'll consider your debt paid and let you go."
"How long will it take for you to get tired of me?"
"About twenty times, and I won't get tired."
However, instead of getting tired, the thirst only grew stronger.
He wanted to see, touch, and possess him. Once he had his body, he found himself desiring his heart as well.
"Why don't I ever get to see that cheap smile of yours?"
"You'll never see me smile in front of you, even if I die."
Taesin couldn't understand why Han hated him so much, and Han couldn't fathom Taesin's obsession with him.
Thus, the tangled threads of a complex relationship began to weave between the two, as distant from the end of the world as they could be. Can these two people, who seem so far apart from the rest of the world, really be together?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[When Yu Jing was 19 years old, she still hadn’t differentiated, but it didn’t affect her image as a beautiful and strong Alpha in the eyes of her fans.
Three years after her debut, she won over a huge group of loyal fans while somehow gaining an enemy—actress Ming Zhu, known as the queen of ratings.
Ming Zhu was an Alpha; sheclashed with Yu Jing at an event, and Yu Jing thought they’d never cross paths again. But, by some twist of fate, they were invited to the same reality show.
Before filming even started, their fans were already tearing each other apart on Weibo.
Yu Jing couldn’t resist checking the comments and got angrier the more she read.
She could accept being called a has-been, and she could tolerate accusations of riding Ming Zhu’s fame. But someone dared question her gender, saying she’d definitely differentiate as an Omega???
Yu Jing suppressed the urge to jump into the fray, secretly swearing: Once I differentiate into a top-tier Alpha, I’ll crush all you haters and your idol into the ground!
Then she differentiated into a delicate Omega.
And got pinned against the wall by Ming Zhu.
In an intimate room—
Ming Zhu’s fingers brushed over the fragile skin hiding her gland, looking down at the person in her arms, her tone soft: “Are you okay?”
Yu Jing’s hands weakly clung to her neck, her cheeks flushed, her voice soft and pleading:
“Mark me already, please.”
<hr />
<strong>Warnings:</strong>
1. Lots of original world-building, Alphas don’t have male anatomy.
2. Melodramatic plot, slow-burn romance, proceed with caution if it’s not your thing.

      <description><![CDATA[What made Jiang Chuxie collapse even more than transmigrating into a blood-type novel was that she became the scumbag Alpha dad of the book’s female lead… or rather, mom?
The scumbag Alpha mom relied on the female lead’s mother, Gu Lingjun, to rise to wealth and prominence. She teamed up with her mistress to kill the original wife and seize the family fortune that should have belonged to the female lead, setting the stage for the female lead’s tragic life.
As for the ending, this scumbag Alpha naturally didn’t fare well either. She was ultimately ruined by her daughter’s six Alphas, left with a shattered family and no place to be buried.
Jiang Chuxie had no desire to follow in the original body’s footsteps. She didn’t want to be a scumbag, nor did she want to be killed. She just wanted to live peacefully… Wait, why does the person sleeping beside her look so much like… Gu Lingjun?
Jiang Chuxie couldn’t escape the fate of an ABO novel. Forced to marry due to pregnancy and reluctantly accepting her fate, the gentle Omega, who had always been submissive, suddenly changed drastically. She broke up, threw money at her, and ran off pregnant, turning the tables and making Jiang Chuxie the one who got played.
Jiang Chuxie: Wait, isn’t something off with this plot?
Gu Lingjun: If it’s off, that’s just right.

      <description><![CDATA[A light-hearted, humorous, face-slapping, satisfying read.
A quirky and clever Alpha × a cold, black lotus Omega.
Jiang Ci transmigrated into the role of a cannon-fodder villain in an ancient ABO novel.
The original body, a prestigious first-rank military marquis with illustrious battle achievements, married the female lead out of lust for her beauty.
After marriage, his true nature was revealed: he imprisoned and abused her, and as a womanizer, he filled his courtyard with concubines, favoring them over his wife... In the end, he was mutilated by the blackened princess, who removed his gland, severed his limbs, and locked him in a pitch-dark dungeon.
When Jiang Ci transmigrated, she found herself straddling the female lead, engaged in unspeakable acts.
Jiang Ci immediately revealed her true self: "I'm not Gao Yi! I won't take the blame for this! I can even prove it by breakdancing!"
Female lead: "???"
The system issued a task: "Please fix the messed-up plot, torment the female lead, and promote her descent into darkness."
Jiang Ci: "No time for you."
System: "???"
…
Jiang Ci had been single for over twenty years and had only ever liked one fictional character.
Now that she had transmigrated into her lord, how could she not seize this heaven-sent opportunity?
No matter who you are, she would confront heaven and earth, and teach a lesson to anyone who bullied the female lead!
After all, she had become the villain—it would be a shame not to act domineering and arrogant!
She gave her all to the female lead, protecting her at every turn, helping her build her career, and imparting all her skills... Only to eventually realize that she was just a substitute, that the female lead had always harbored a white moonlight in her heart.
All the ambiguity between them was because she resembled that person.
Jiang Ci: "Can I know who she is?"
Female lead: "No."
Jiang Ci was finally numb. Heartbroken and disillusioned, she exchanged rewards with the system and returned to her original world.
…
Later, the woman who had ascended to the pinnacle of power got drunk at a palace banquet. "Have you found her?"
Maid: "Your Highness has forgotten, she was a soul transmigrator, not belonging to this world. We don't even know her real name."
The wine cup fell to the ground, and the woman's eyes dimmed.
…
When Jiang Ci woke up again, she found herself still in the novel, but now she had transmigrated into her own body, and ten years had passed.
The young girl she once needed to protect had now become the powerful and influential Grand Princess. It was said that this Grand Princess was cold and aloof, with her only peculiar hobby being to capture those with eccentric personalities and suspected of having delusions.
Jiang Ci wanted nothing to do with the Grand Princess this time and tried her best to keep her identity hidden.
However, the Grand Princess, after ten years, had thoroughly studied all of Jiang Ci's tactics, surpassing her teacher and excelling even further.

      <description><![CDATA[Noah, a masochist who enjoys pain. One day, due to his father's arbitrary decision, he is forced into an arranged political marriage with a man named Ian Miller...
"...Ah, I got it right this time? Yeah, I'll use this for my fiancé. What of it?" Ian's voice continued soothingly. "Even if I just torment him a little, that young master will run off crying to his daddy. If he's an alpha, he might even be traumatized."
In this world, is this a dream or reality? Is my fiancé now buying adult toys from my favorite club just to torment me? That sounded far more alluring and sweet than any love confession Noah had ever heard. Noah immediately changed the resolve he had just made to not marry Ian Miller. Someone who would even pluck a star from the sky for him is nothing special, and someone who hates him is nothing special either, but someone who will torment him is most welcome. This marriage must happen! It absolutely must! The delusion and love between a lovable, cute masochist and a lone, serious bad guy!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Shen Hanzhi woke up and found herself transmigrated into a novel as the villainous Alpha with the same name. The original Shen Hanzhi forced Wen Jin, a pitiful female protagonist from a fallen family, to marry her. She plundered Wen Jin’s possessions, forcibly marked her, and, after growing bored, brought a lover home to provoke the already pregnant Wen Jin.
Wen Jin lost her child and was imprisoned by Shen Hanzhi in a villa; she was completely blackened. Later, with the help of the male protagonist Liang Shuo, Wen Jin escaped the Shen family and ruined Shen Hanzhi’s reputation, leaving her as a madwoman on the streets.
Shen Hanzhi received the original novel’s plot. When she regained her senses, she was putting a wedding ring on Wen Jin’s finger. She turned to flee the wedding scene, but before she could move, her central nervous system received a shock.
Along with the shock, a strange voice echoed in her mind: The host cannot act out of character, or the villainous Alpha system will judge it as immediate death. At this, Shen Hanzhi felt completely numb!
Thus, Shen Hanzhi and Wen Jin’s daily life became like this:
Shen Hanzhi glared fiercely at Wen Jin: “You wrote my name so uglily, so you must write it ten more times as punishment!”
Shen Hanzhi stared at the delicate girl on the bed with a harsh tone: “I told you eight hundred times to eat more green peppers for nutrition, but you picked them out again!”
Wen Jin lived in a quagmire. She was an illegitimate daughter treated as a shame by the Wen family, living worse than a dog. Before leaving the Wen family at nineteen, she couldn’t even read.
A woman named Shen Hanzhi taught her to read, took her to various places to have fun, and gave her the life a person should have. Her Sister Shen was perfect in every way, except her tone sometimes sounded fierce.
But when Wen Jin watched TV, she understood it was the flirtation between wives, so she wasn’t afraid. When Wen Jin turned twenty, Shen Hanzhi finally accumulated enough villainous Alpha points to divorce the girl and live her own life.
But the girl hugged her neck and coquettishly said: “Sister, I like it when you bully me.”]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Yu Heyi received a wedding invitation from the Omega she had secretly loved for years, she was lying in a hospital bed.
She got into a car accident during a race and had to retire.
Under the double blow, Yu Heyi accepted her mom’s suggestion.
Going on a blind date.
Her mom praised the other person like crazy, saying they were a perfect Omega, beautiful and soft and gentle.
Then…
She found out the blind date was her most hated person, no one else came close!
Her love rival—Chi Ruixi.
She still hadn’t figured out how her beta love rival turned into an Omega.
And on the day of the blind date, she marked her.
It was Chi Ruixi, crying and begging her to mark her…
Afterward, Yu Heyi said three things.
“I’ll take responsibility, I’ll fulfill an Alpha’s duties.”
“I’ll treat you well, I’ll be considerate.”
“But don’t expect love.”
Chi Ruixi heard this, gave a slight smile, and said, “No need.”
Jobless Yu Heyi was arranged by her mom to work as a chef in the cafeteria of XX Middle School.
She found out the gentle and delicate literature teacher was—Chi Ruixi?
But Chi Ruixi’s cold words made her feel weird, a bit uncomfortable.
Yu Heyi thought it was pheromones that drew her to Chi Ruixi, otherwise why would she find
Chi Ruixi, the bridesmaid at the wedding, way more charming than the bride she’d loved for years.
Then, in a daze, she permanently marked Chi Ruixi.
Chi Ruixi kept waiting for that dumb Alpha to admit she loved her, but her dumb Alpha was truly dumb.

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao died tragically.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The man she had saved and cared for for many years despised her and shattered her spirit veins with his own hands and dissolved her body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. I have waited for this day.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan's ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And Ning Yao's lifelong wish is to ascend.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft—those fools don’t know his worth. He’s from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it works, great. If not… well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions. When that happens, their instincts will turn against their beloved, giving rise to an uncontrollable urge to kill.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slay one’s beloved, attain enlightenment, ascend immediately, and forget the past.</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfect outcome for both.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao knew that Feng Jingzhuo had already begun to grow his heart’s scales.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, he endured the agonizing pain, hiding away to claw open his own chest. He ripped out the endlessly growing scales, pinned his own hands down with bone nails—desperately resisting his dragon instincts.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I beg you… whatever you do, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’ll be over soon. Be good. Stay outside…”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside, Ning Yao pondered, if</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we can both ascend, that’s better than neither of us ascending at all.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, she went in.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as she always did, she held him in her arms, kissing his trembling, pale lips with tenderness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After many 10 thousand years, Ning Yao was reborn and successfully ascended.</span>
She forgot Feng Jingzhou, but he remembered her.
Tormenting himself, he wanted to turn back time.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao was very happy, but the ceremony of conferring the gods was a little simple.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the entire world of gods was busy trying to stop a fallen god who wants to activate the forbidden Time-Reversal Array.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Theme: My heart is controlled by me, not by heavens.</span>

This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.
No! I don't want you to express it with your body either!]]></description>

Among them, Bai Tingzhou stands out for his remarkable achievements in the National High School Math Competition, which earns him a lot of attention. He was known as the "untouchable treasure" of Hengshan First High School and a favorite of the guidance director. He could only be admired from afar; many people tried to add him on WeChat but found that they couldn't even find his account.
Meanwhile, the third-year students are stressed about their upcoming class placement exams. Xu Mu brings news of a new, beautiful transfer student, Li Yansui, who wants to join their top science class. This news stirs curiosity and excitement among the students, though Bai Tingzhou and his friend Qi Jinyang remain uninterested.
A playful confrontation between Qi Jinyang and Bai Tingzhou is interrupted by the arrival of Mr. Wang and Li Yansui, who surprise Bai Tingzhou by revealing their past acquaintance.

      <description><![CDATA[To survive, Sheng Nuan must traverse different worlds, playing the role of self-destructive cannon fodder while saving the darkest villains. These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand. Holding the cannon fodder's script, Sheng Nuan is terrified...
Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

      <title>Transmigrating Before The Crazy Beauty Scum A Loses Control</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Summary 1:
"Even if it's a one-for-one trade, I will take over his company."
These were the last words Luan Yenan said before transmigrating into a book.
As the sole head of a Fortune 500 investment company, she never expected her end to be dying from overwork after three sleepless days and nights, only to transmigrate into a novel.
The character she transmigrated into was a crazy, abusive Alpha who tormented the female lead before having her glands removed by the seemingly innocent but secretly cunning female lead.
Crazy? Perfect, I’m crazy too.
Abusive Alpha? Sorry, I’m single and not interested.
As for the female lead, are you talking about the little girl I’ve pinned down, teary-eyed and begging for mercy?
Seemingly innocent but secretly cunning? Interesting.
Let me personally train her. I want to see how she plans to cut out my glands.
Summary 2:
Zuo Baixuan, who had just differentiated into an Omega, was sold by her adoptive parents to a crazy, abusive Alpha. She thought her life would be plunged into darkness from then on.
Unexpectedly, on the first day of their marriage, when she was pinned down, the Alpha, who was on the verge of losing control, suddenly calmed down and retracted her pheromones after Zuo Baixuan said, "I want to graduate smoothly, I don’t want to have a child so early."
After that, the previously good-for-nothing Alpha seemed like a completely different person. She became a guest professor at the university, started a company, helped Zuo Baixuan seek revenge, and together they reached the pinnacle of life.
One day, Luan Yenan’s pheromones went haywire, and she lay on her deathbed: "I’ll set you free, let’s get a divorce."
Zuo Baixuan chuckled, grabbed Luan Yenan’s hands, and pulled her closer: "I’ve already graduated."
"So?"
"I want to have a child. With you."
Let’s see who’s really the crazy one.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[At the princess's banquet, in a secluded hall, Helan Ci pressed her palm against the wall, encountering the equally disheveled newly crowned top scholar Lu Wuyou. One was as delicate as a willow, the other had a flushed face.
Their eyes met, and in each other's gaze, they saw a glimmer of despair.
"I'll go first..."
"I'll head that way..."
However, what was even more despairing was the sound of the princess's maid and the second prince's attendant searching for them not far away.
Helan Ci bit her lip: "What don't you just go to the princess?"
Lu Wuyou endured: "I think the second prince is not bad either."
Helan Ci: "If we keep talking, we'll only end up hurting each other!"
Lu Wuyou closed his eyes: "Then let it be a mutual destruction."
Helan Ci: "…?"
A night later, their innocence was lost, and they were forced into marriage. Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband's demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.
Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”
Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to. Who told me to marry you— I’m going to be a powerful minister. I can’t fall here.”
Helan Ci, “Then do your best! I’m counting on you!”
Lu Wuyou, “…?”
Years later, Lu Wuyou became the Prime Minister, holding the highest position among officials, wielding immense power across the land, and reflecting on the past.
A student asked him how he had come this far.
Prime Minister Lu thought to himself that as long as one marries a wife of extraordinary beauty, often coveted by others, it would always inspire one to strive to make progress.

      <description><![CDATA[After the daughter of the former mistress of the Jing'an Marquis's residence, Wen Zhuojin, fell from grace and lost all support after her uncle's family declined, the engagement with the heir of the Rongguo Duke's residence was snatched away by her stepsister.
After the broken engagement, rumors spread that Wen Zhuojin, who was said to be in mourning at home, disguised herself and went to a brothel in the western market of Yun Jing City. There, she bought the freedom of a young courtesan, taking her in and treating her like a precious jewel at a house she had prepared for her outside.
The world believed that the engagement had been stolen from Wen Zhuojin, but in fact, it was a marriage she had long wanted to cancel.
This was because Wen Zhuojin did not like men; she loved women, especially beautiful, mature women older than herself.
The beautiful woman she brought home perfectly met her criteria.
To support her lover, Wen Zhuojin worked hard in business, spending more on her lover’s clothes and living expenses than the courtiers in the palace.
However, Wen Zhuojin could not openly give her lover a formal title, which made her feel guilty toward her.
When she entered the palace to meet with the nobility, hoping to spend a fortune to secure a title for her beloved, Wen Zhuojin came face to face with the current Princess Royal.
The Princess Royal wore a hibiscus crown and a black and blue ceremonial robe, holding a dust whisk. Her demeanor was as cold as a snow-capped mountain, exuding aloof elegance and an unworldly air.
It was said that at the age of fifteen, the Princess Royal had helped her younger brother ascend the throne, quelled rebellions, subdued neighboring nations, and ruled decisively. She wielded unparalleled power and commanded universal reverence.
She was also the woman Wen Zhuojin feared most.
While everyone else knelt in respect, Wen Zhuojin stood frozen, trembling, staring in shock at the Princess.
Who could tell her why the Princess looked exactly like her delicate and helpless lover sister?!
————
At the age of twenty, Princess Royal Yan Qinglan took her vows as a Taoist nun, swearing never to marry. She never expected that, at twenty-six, she would be poisoned, lose her sight, and be sweetly coaxed by a soft-voiced girl who brought her home.
At that time, Yan Qinglan was trapped in a predicament. When she approached the girl, she noticed that the girl’s faint fragrance eased the pain of her poison flare-ups. She decided to follow the girl home to see what she was up to.
The girl indeed had intentions for Yan Qinglan—but not the kind Yan Qinglan imagined.
Exquisite meals, fine clothes, and extravagant luxury surrounded her. Within days, Princess Yan Qinglan was pampered, becoming even softer and more delicate, her beauty becoming truly unmatched.
And all the girl asked for in return was—
"Sister, kiss me."
"Sister, hug me."
"Sister, cuddle me."
The sweet voice, with a tone of coquettishness, whispered and enticed her every day.
Slowly, Princess Yan Qinglan began to yearn for it. Even after her sight was restored, she continued to be the girl's "concubine" while stirring up the political scene, vying for power and influence.
————
Wen Zhuojin, upon realizing that Princess Yan Qinglan and her beautiful sister were the same person, packed her things and fled overnight. But before she could leave the city gates, she was surrounded by the Imperial Guard.
Looking at the woman she once teased to tears and coaxed into embarrassing acts, now brimming with murderous intent, Wen Zhuojin was petrified.
“Ah Zhuo, if you leave, who will be my Empress?”
Just as Wen Zhuojin thought her life was over, Yan Qinglan suddenly embraced her and whispered in her ear—]]></description>

Use your "knowledge of otome games" to live as a commoner in hiding?

--Leaving your fate in the hands of others is utterly laughable.
Friendship and love are unnecessary. If it's for revenge, I'll bow my head, but I will always crush them all later, without fail.
This is the story of Gloria, a villainous noblewoman who is wholly dedicated to revenge.
Gloria, of the Duke of Caldwell's family, was accused of injuring the saint who had received the crown prince's true love at her graduation party. Then, she was framed for another crime she didn't commit and was executed. She died cursing everything in this world that had wronged her, but when she woke up, she was ten years old again, revived.
At the same time, a ghost from another world appeared, saying, "This is the world of otome games, and Gloria is a villainous lady." But instead of ignoring it, she made the ghost submit and decided to live her second life solely for revenge.

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!
What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!
With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!
She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”
She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”
She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”
Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”
Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”

      <title>The Male Lead's Harem Belongs to Me (GL)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Jiang Han died from staying up too late reading a novel, and after her death, she found herself transported into the ancient melodramatic romance novel she had been reading.
The male lead is a cold and domineering prince, and the female lead is the prince's long-cherished "white moonlight". Unfortunately, the white moonlight has a lowly status, and the prince's mother disapproves. The male lead goes to great lengths, enduring countless melodramatic events, heart-wrenching and physically exhausting, ultimately winning the heart of his beloved and achieving a happy ending. And Jiang Han is one of the cannon fodder female characters who, out of jealousy, targeted the male lead's white moonlight.
Jiang Han, who traveled through time, said: "No way, I just want to be a salted fish and play mahjong every day."
So when the male lead said: "I want to marry my white moonlight."
Jiang Han: Marry! You must marry! The gifts are all ready.
The male lead said: "She is timid and frail. As the princess, you should take good care of her."
Jiang Han: Take care! Must take care of !Tomorrow, I'll have her live next to me!
The male lead said: "She's too considerate. She won't speak up about her needs, so you should be more accommodating to her."
Jiang Han: Move! Must yield! Tomorrow, I will divorce you and give the title of princess to her!
••••
The next day, Jiang Han indeed handed him a divorce letter. The male lead, feeling complicated, signed it, but Jiang Han happily prepared to leave. Just as she reached the gate of the mansion, a group of concubines led by White Moonlight blocked her way.
White Moonlight: Sister Jiang, don't go. Would you stay?
A group of concubines: Yeah, yeah, please don't leave.
Jiang Han showed a troubled expression, and the male lead's heart was filled with joy. Just as he was about to say a few words of persuasion, he saw Jiang Han decisively shake her head.
The male lead thought it was a pity. Before he could catch his breath, he saw the person he held dear, his "white moonlight," take out a divorce agreement and coldly say to him, "Sign it. I want to leave with Sister Jiang."
The male lead stared wide-eyed in disbelief, a mouthful of old blood choked in his chest. However, the next moment, his group of concubines gritted their teeth and said to White Moonlight: "Weiwei, you are being too ungrateful. Why did you prepare the divorce papers all by yourself without telling us?"
#My harem seems to have turned into my princess's, what should I do#
#Is it too late to regret now#
••••
One-on-one [highlight this], before the divorce, they were just pure revolutionary comrades and good friends. After the divorce, there will be romantic developments.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The little blind girl was stopped by a group of delinquents on the way home from school. The group of boys groped her breasts and even wanted to check if she was a virg*n. The little blind girl was so angry that she took out chili powder and sprayed it all over, then turned around and ran. She was completely lost and was almost hit by a car. One of the delinquents rushed over and hugged her, pointed at her and scolding in a loud voice, “Are you blind! Why did you run onto the road!”
&nbsp;
Yes, she was blind. The little blind girl burst into tears, her throat choking up, and the soft cloth on her eyes slipped off.
&nbsp;
The delinquent boy looked straight at her, “F*ck me?”
&nbsp;
“Let go… of me.” The little blind girl struggled against him.
&nbsp;
The delinquent boy looked at her pretty face and gulped, “What’s your name? Tell me, and I’ll let you go.”
&nbsp;
“…S-Su Ruan.” The little blind girl cried.
&nbsp;
“F*ck…” The delinquent boy l**ked the tip of his teeth and looked down at the tent in his pants. His voice had even become a little hoarse. “What a coincidence. My name is Hella Hard.”]]></description>

Holding the cannon fodder's script, Sheng Nuan is terrified...
Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Synopsis: </span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin Yuran never would have thought that the client sitting across from her, forcing them both to work together, was the high school classmate she had rejected long ago, Chi Ye.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two maintained a distant yet courteous relationship, keeping their distance as they worked together.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Lin Yuran gradually felt something wasn't quite right.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, why did this man insist on her working at his company instead of her own studio? And moreover, how come her office just so happened to be directly opposite his?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another instance, when Lin Yuran accepted a ride in another man's Rolls-Royce Phantom, Chi Ye only sighed, "I thought I'd never get to ride a luxury car like this in my life."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The very next day, Chi Ye's car changed to a Bentley, then Bugatti, followed by Koenigsegg... Another time, Lin Yuran accidentally stumbled upon Chi Ye's Baidu profile and discovered that her favorite lollipop factory was registered under his name.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But rumor had it that the factory closed five years ago, and that some mysterious big shot loved eating these lollipops, so he bought the factory and continued production regardless of profit or loss, no matter what the situation.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous clues led Lin Yuran to suspect—</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chi Ye still liked her?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Little did she know, even their second encounter was part of his plan.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Chi Ye remained unaware that on that sweltering afternoon six years ago, Lin Yuran had quietly watched his lonely figure from afar and murmured softly, "If we meet again someday, I hope I can respond to you."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, only the wind heard her confession.</span>]]></description>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone said that she was born with Phoenix Jade* in her mouth— destined for greatness from the very start.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, fate took a cruel turn.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A woman from the modern era arrived and transformed Shen Guiyan’s once-brash younger sister into someone sharp and clever. She stole her fiancé, harmed her birth mother, and ruthlessly pulled her down from the heavens. Laughing arrogantly, she sneered, “How can a mere woman from the feudal era ever compete with a modern woman of the 21st century?”</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Schemes and trickery altered her predestined fate, a pregnant belly destroyed her marriage prospects, and she was forced to marry a spoiled and troublemaking son of a noble, who brought ruin upon her on her supposed wedding night. And yet,  by some strange twist of fate, it inadvertently led her to the most extraordinary encounter with her fated one.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A crazy monk once read her fortune: a great calamity at the coming of age, a great joy at the age of twenty, and a great sorrow in old age.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Shen Guiyan did not believe in fate. She only believed that with human determination, one could even overcome destiny.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who took from her, she would make sure they would pay! Those who harmed her, she would make sure they would burn in the pits of hell! </span>

      <description><![CDATA[General Qi Ren, known as the "Mad Wolf" was once an undefeated war god. However, he was poisoned by an enemy spy on the battlefield, which left him mentally impaired, leading to the tragic downfall of a legendary hero. The Emperor, relieved to have neutralized this formidable threat to his throne, felt a twinge of guilt. Hearing rumors that the "madman" harbored affection for the timid and mute Seventh Prince, Fu Yu'an, the Emperor decided to arrange their marriage, believing it to be a benevolent gesture.  
However, after the wedding, Fu Yu'an, who had to play both father and mother to the seemingly foolish general, was shocked when he saw the "madman" climbing into his bed with clear, calculating eyes. Fu Yu'an kicked him off and exclaimed, "You're not a fool?"  
To which Qi Ren retorted, "And you're not mute, are you? We're both hiding our true selves—so why the disdain?"

      <description><![CDATA[After drinking too much at my retirement celebration, I woke up to find myself inexplicably transformed into a beautiful young boy in another world. In this world where magic reigns supreme, there's a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a 'stud' in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[To survive, Sheng Nuan must traverse different worlds, playing the role of self-destructive cannon fodder while saving the darkest villains. These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand. Holding the cannon fodder's script, Sheng Nuan is terrified...
Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

She was a straight woman, crossed into a porn game she played years ago.
She wondered why the hell it was a modified version.
Did it want to drive her mad?

Wei Qing calmed her mood and often looked at the obedient cute girl with loving eyes.
She nodded satisfactorily—she was a good child.
Wei Qing drank the water the girl handed her without caution.
She went to bed and felt especially sleepy today.
She grew somewhat drowsy...
——
<em>Today’s dream... why was it especially real?</em>
The girl was completely naked; she straddled her waist.

      <description><![CDATA[A light-hearted, humorous, face-slapping, satisfying read.
A quirky and clever Alpha × a cold, black lotus Omega.
Jiang Ci transmigrated into the role of a cannon-fodder villain in an ancient ABO novel.
The original body, a prestigious first-rank military marquis with illustrious battle achievements, married the female lead out of lust for her beauty.
After marriage, his true nature was revealed: he imprisoned and abused her, and as a womanizer, he filled his courtyard with concubines, favoring them over his wife... In the end, he was mutilated by the blackened princess, who removed his gland, severed his limbs, and locked him in a pitch-dark dungeon.
When Jiang Ci transmigrated, she found herself straddling the female lead, engaged in unspeakable acts.
Jiang Ci immediately revealed her true self: "I'm not Gao Yi! I won't take the blame for this! I can even prove it by breakdancing!"
Female lead: "???"
The system issued a task: "Please fix the messed-up plot, torment the female lead, and promote her descent into darkness."
Jiang Ci: "No time for you."
System: "???"
…
Jiang Ci had been single for over twenty years and had only ever liked one fictional character.
Now that she had transmigrated into her lord, how could she not seize this heaven-sent opportunity?
No matter who you are, she would confront heaven and earth, and teach a lesson to anyone who bullied the female lead!
After all, she had become the villain—it would be a shame not to act domineering and arrogant!
She gave her all to the female lead, protecting her at every turn, helping her build her career, and imparting all her skills... Only to eventually realize that she was just a substitute, that the female lead had always harbored a white moonlight in her heart.
All the ambiguity between them was because she resembled that person.
Jiang Ci: "Can I know who she is?"
Female lead: "No."
Jiang Ci was finally numb. Heartbroken and disillusioned, she exchanged rewards with the system and returned to her original world.
…
Later, the woman who had ascended to the pinnacle of power got drunk at a palace banquet. "Have you found her?"
Maid: "Your Highness has forgotten, she was a soul transmigrator, not belonging to this world. We don't even know her real name."
The wine cup fell to the ground, and the woman's eyes dimmed.
…
When Jiang Ci woke up again, she found herself still in the novel, but now she had transmigrated into her own body, and ten years had passed.
The young girl she once needed to protect had now become the powerful and influential Grand Princess. It was said that this Grand Princess was cold and aloof, with her only peculiar hobby being to capture those with eccentric personalities and suspected of having delusions.
Jiang Ci wanted nothing to do with the Grand Princess this time and tried her best to keep her identity hidden.
However, the Grand Princess, after ten years, had thoroughly studied all of Jiang Ci's tactics, surpassing her teacher and excelling even further.

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao died tragically.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The man she had saved and cared for for many years despised her and shattered her spirit veins with his own hands and dissolved her body.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. I have waited for this day.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ning Yao is from the ancient Bodhi clan, kind by nature but without a heart.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> One year, she rescued a demon from the hands of the immortal Xuanmen, who was tortured and dying. She took good care of him, curing his years of illness and scars.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> She did not mind his humble status and liked him wholeheartedly, always smiling, hugging, and kissing him.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every time at that moment, Feng Jingzhuo felt pity and helplessness, and his love deepened.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Little Bodhi (Ning Yao) cured his disabled and ugly body and cured his inferiority, self-loathing, sensitivity, and paranoia.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How could he not be infatuated and loyal and love her deeply?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But what Feng Jingzhuo did not know was that according to the rules of the Bodhi clan's ascension, one must first save others to prove the truth and then die and be reborn before ascending.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And Ning Yao's lifelong wish is to ascend.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That year, the eldest sister failed to ascend to heaven, and before she and her brother-in-law retired to the world sweetly, she pointed out a clear path for Ning Yao:</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, our Bodhi clan is too beloved. Who could bear to use us as a stepping stone for enlightenment?”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re truly set on it, why not try that demon imprisoned by the immortal sect? Pfft—those fools don’t know his worth. He’s from the Cangyuan Dragon Clan.”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If it works, great. If not… well, you could always fall in love, just like I did.”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Her elder sister revealed a secret about the Cangyuan Dragon Clan:</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If they fall deeply enough in love, their hearts will grow scales to shield them from their emotions. When that happens, their instincts will turn against their beloved, giving rise to an uncontrollable urge to kill.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slay one’s beloved, attain enlightenment, ascend immediately, and forget the past.</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfect outcome for both.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao knew that Feng Jingzhuo had already begun to grow his heart’s scales.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, he endured the agonizing pain, hiding away to claw open his own chest. He ripped out the endlessly growing scales, pinned his own hands down with bone nails—desperately resisting his dragon instincts.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yao Yao, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I beg you… whatever you do, don’t come in…”</span></i>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’ll be over soon. Be good. Stay outside…”</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside, Ning Yao pondered, if</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we can both ascend, that’s better than neither of us ascending at all.</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, she went in.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as she always did, she held him in her arms, kissing his trembling, pale lips with tenderness.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After many 10 thousand years, Ning Yao was reborn and successfully ascended.</span>
She forgot Feng Jingzhou, but he remembered her.
Tormenting himself, he wanted to turn back time.
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ning Yao was very happy, but the ceremony of conferring the gods was a little simple.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the entire world of gods was busy trying to stop a fallen god who wants to activate the forbidden Time-Reversal Array.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">　　</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Theme: My heart is controlled by me, not by heavens.</span>
