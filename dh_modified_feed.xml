      <description><![CDATA[Everyone in the capital knew that the Marquess’s wife, Lan Qingxi, was despised by her in-laws, abused by her mother-in-law, and merely a plaything of the treacherous Song Linyuan. People expected her to be divorced, thrown into a pond, and abandoned, ending up in a pitiful state. But one day, when Lan Qingxi was about to leave the Marquess’s residence, Song Linyuan waited at the door, wiping the dust from her shoes, carefully helping her into the bridal sedan, and leading a procession to marry her. That’s when everyone realized they had misjudged the situation.
After their marriage, Song Linyuan said, “Madam, it’s rumored in the capital that I fear my wife.”
Lan Qingxi innocently replied, “Who has the audacity to spread such rumors about the Prime Minister? Drag them out and execute them.”
Song Linyuan: “I did.”
Lan Qingxi: “……”
Lan Qingxi’s saying: Successfully performing in front of a scumbag is called lying. Successfully performing in front of Song Linyuan is called winning at life.

      <description><![CDATA[Lin Chu, an engineering student, was following a novel and found the villain character especially compelling. When she read the part where the villain was forced to marry a manipulative woman during his downfall, Lin Chu couldn’t help but criticize the green tea character.
Who would have expected that she’d black out, only to become that very same troublesome woman who regretted her marriage to the villain on their wedding day and ultimately got herself killed?
Lin Chu: “…”
Stay calm, don’t panic.
Looking at the villainous husband, injured and returning from the battlefield, Lin Chu thought she had found her chance to escape her tragic fate by clinging to his leg for survival…

      <description><![CDATA[To survive, Sheng Nuan must traverse different worlds, playing the role of self-destructive cannon fodder while saving the darkest villains. These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand. Holding the cannon fodder's script, Sheng Nuan is terrified...
Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

      <title>After Rebirth, I Married my Archenemy</title>
      <chaptername>Chapter 74</chaptername>
      <nameextend>a conversation turned confidential</nameextend>
      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/after-rebirth-i-married-my-archenemy/volume-2-a-blade-drawn-on-the-bowstring/chapter-74/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.
After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor's chest: "Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?"
The new emperor kissed her: "You will be fine, just love me."
The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: "Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left."
When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess's obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official's wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.
Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.
------
The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.
Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.
For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, "The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated," before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. Blood poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.
When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.
Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: "Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?"
"... She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore."
Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: "She said she won't fight, so the fight is over?"

      <description><![CDATA["A Marriage in Name Only, Yet 'My Wife' and 'My Husband' Are Too Perfect!"
From a young age, Rubel was called a saint due to her bond with the spirits and her immense magical prowess, drafted into countless battlefields. Yet when peace was finally achieved, her reward was an annulled engagement to the prince and a royal command: oversee the haunted Forest of Death, teeming with monstrous beasts, and marry the so-called “Barbarian Count,” a margrave of the frontier.
The Barbarian Count was said to be a man who spent his days battling monstrous creatures, obsessed with wealth, and reputed to be so terrifying in appearance that a mere glance could make someone faint.
But Rubel thought, Isn’t this a chance to fulfill my long-held dream of owning my own home?
After punching the prince goodbye, she set off alone for her final task, armed with just her staff and a single trunk, to wed the margrave of the frontier.
However, what awaited her was not the monstrous figure she had expected, but a breathtakingly handsome man with a villainous look that could make anyone weak at the knees.
What was meant to be a marriage in name only soon proved otherwise—her husband was kind, his domain awe-inspiring, and...]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[After drinking too much at my retirement celebration, I woke up to find myself inexplicably transformed into a beautiful young boy in another world. In this world where magic reigns supreme, there's a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a 'stud' in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.
Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.
Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.
Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.
The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…
The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.
That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.
<hr />
Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.
Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.
At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.
He could smile, she realised, but not for her.
From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.
Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.
<hr />
After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.
But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.
On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”
Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”
Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.
For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!
What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!
With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!
She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”
She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”
She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”
Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”
Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!
What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!
With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!
She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”
She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”
She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”
Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”
Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”

      <title>The Female Lead is Looking at Me Differently (GL)</title>

      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/the-female-lead-is-looking-at-me-differently/chapter-21/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Wen Zhao transmigrated into a low-magic Xianxia novel, only to discover she'd become the cannon fodder second female lead who bullied the female lead, seduced the male lead, and was generally a green tea b*tch, lotus-flower-like antagonist.
In the original novel, she was the catalyst for misunderstandings between the male and female leads, a dedicated tool character who lived until the grand finale. In the end, the male and female leads ended up together, while she suffered the consequences.
To avoid a bad ending, Wen Zhao tried her best to cling to the female lead without being too out of character, hoping to safely exit the story.
Although she was still being required by the system to perform actions befitting a second female lead, Wen Zhao believed the female lead would eventually understand her sincere heart!
However, it seemed like the female lead was looking at her a bit strangely?
••••
Male Lead: A Zhao, I suddenly realized that I might actually like you a little.
Wen Zhao: ???
She thought this was the biggest deviation from the plot, but then the female lead slowly approached.
Lowering her gaze slightly, the female lead, whose gaze was usually cold, revealed a hint of obsession and possessiveness. She walked up to Wen Zhao and smiled softly.
She asked softly, "A Zhao, between him and me, who do you choose?"
Wen Zhao: I choose you! I choose you!
••••
One-Sentence Summary: Thank you everyone, I'm with the female lead now.
Theme: Even when facing difficulties, one should strive to overcome them and have the determination to reverse their situation. Only through hard work can one achieve success. Victory and new surprises are waiting not far away.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Gu Yu Qi, a daughter born to a marquis household. She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky. It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.
But what happened to her in the end?
For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.
If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.
Who knew he’d be reborn again…
When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky. Just what are you playing at!?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Everyone in the capital knew that the Marquess’s wife, Lan Qingxi, was despised by her in-laws, abused by her mother-in-law, and merely a plaything of the treacherous Song Linyuan. People expected her to be divorced, thrown into a pond, and abandoned, ending up in a pitiful state. But one day, when Lan Qingxi was about to leave the Marquess’s residence, Song Linyuan waited at the door, wiping the dust from her shoes, carefully helping her into the bridal sedan, and leading a procession to marry her. That’s when everyone realized they had misjudged the situation.
After their marriage, Song Linyuan said, “Madam, it’s rumored in the capital that I fear my wife.”
Lan Qingxi innocently replied, “Who has the audacity to spread such rumors about the Prime Minister? Drag them out and execute them.”
Song Linyuan: “I did.”
Lan Qingxi: “……”
Lan Qingxi’s saying: Successfully performing in front of a scumbag is called lying. Successfully performing in front of Song Linyuan is called winning at life.

It's a cursed world where he struggles every day. Two months have passed since he set foot in the zombie apocalypse world in his dreams. "Ha...." As soon as he woke up, his gaze was instinctively drawn to the internet broadcast that he habitually left on. -A major riot is occurring in some regions due to the current situation... Then, beep! A loud sound announcing a disaster alert echoed in Junseong's head. Unconsciously picking up his phone along with the alarm sound, Junseong couldn't hide his confused expression.
[10:44 AM] It was the exact time he had always woken up in his dream. Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. "I've been wanting to ask you something."
"What?" As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo's gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. "Why do you look at me like that?" Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. "How am I... looking at you?"
"...." Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the 'fake smile' he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of blood was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of blood from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his 'clothes' but emanated from him.``]]></description>

A child was on the way.
We loved each other, were happy together, and dreamed of a future as a family.
But on the way to the obstetrician to meet the baby, an unexpected accident occurred.
Due to the accident, Dokwon didn't open his eyes for a long time, and when he finally came to...
"Omega?"
He didn't remember me.
But I was okay. We loved each other more than anything. I believed without a doubt that we could return to that time.
Dokwon's words hurt, but I could endure it. I could bear it.
"You'll regret this."
"Me? What will I regret?"
"Talking to me like that."
"What?"
"Treating me poorly. Treating me like a gold digger. Seeing me as an empty-headed omega who only emits pheromones. You'll regret it later."
But the world relentlessly pushed us to the edge.
And finally,
"Let's end this here."
"...What?"
"Get rid of the baby."
"...What did you say?"
"Let's end this without causing any more disgrace. Eunsoo Yoo."
The end tore us apart.
Left standing alone at the end... I fervently wished for death.]]></description>

When I opened my eyes, I found myself woke up 500 years later in a world that had already been destroyed.
A monster suddenly appears from the gate.
'Esper', a godlike creature who has awakened his powers follow its lead.
And the world is completely different from the past. Humans are no longer the masters of the Earth.
The Espers, who are supposed to hunt monsters and protect the city, are actually leading the world to further destruction due to their rampage. The 'Guides' that could calm the Espers have already disappeared.
But then.
"I'm a guide?"
The only guide who miraculously woke up in a discarded hibernation capsule.
Yeo-won creates a guiding drug that slows down the rampage and distributes it around the world.
Thus, the world is one step away from destruction,
but now she must protect herself from the espers who seek to find and possess the guide.

Will it be able to moisten the earth, or will it dry up and disappear in the heat.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[At the princess's banquet, in a secluded hall, Helan Ci pressed her palm against the wall, encountering the equally disheveled newly crowned top scholar Lu Wuyou. One was as delicate as a willow, the other had a flushed face.
Their eyes met, and in each other's gaze, they saw a glimmer of despair.
"I'll go first..."
"I'll head that way..."
However, what was even more despairing was the sound of the princess's maid and the second prince's attendant searching for them not far away.
Helan Ci bit her lip: "What don't you just go to the princess?"
Lu Wuyou endured: "I think the second prince is not bad either."
Helan Ci: "If we keep talking, we'll only end up hurting each other!"
Lu Wuyou closed his eyes: "Then let it be a mutual destruction."
Helan Ci: "…?"
A night later, their innocence was lost, and they were forced into marriage. Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband's demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.
Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”
Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to. Who told me to marry you— I’m going to be a powerful minister. I can’t fall here.”
Helan Ci, “Then do your best! I’m counting on you!”
Lu Wuyou, “…?”
Years later, Lu Wuyou became the Prime Minister, holding the highest position among officials, wielding immense power across the land, and reflecting on the past.
A student asked him how he had come this far.
Prime Minister Lu thought to himself that as long as one marries a wife of extraordinary beauty, often coveted by others, it would always inspire one to strive to make progress.

      <description><![CDATA[Noah, a masochist who enjoys pain. One day, due to his father's arbitrary decision, he is forced into an arranged political marriage with a man named Ian Miller...
"...Ah, I got it right this time? Yeah, I'll use this for my fiancé. What of it?" Ian's voice continued soothingly. "Even if I just torment him a little, that young master will run off crying to his daddy. If he's an alpha, he might even be traumatized."
In this world, is this a dream or reality? Is my fiancé now buying adult toys from my favorite club just to torment me? That sounded far more alluring and sweet than any love confession Noah had ever heard. Noah immediately changed the resolve he had just made to not marry Ian Miller. Someone who would even pluck a star from the sky for him is nothing special, and someone who hates him is nothing special either, but someone who will torment him is most welcome. This marriage must happen! It absolutely must! The delusion and love between a lovable, cute masochist and a lone, serious bad guy!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[※ This work contains immoral subject matter, violent acts, and descriptions of coercive relationships, among other things. Additionally, the settings, backgrounds, and characters in the work are all fictional. Please keep this in mind while enjoying the story.
Han's simple daily life working part-time at a convenience store is suddenly turned upside down.
"Your debt amounts to a total of one hundred million and seven thousand."
With a timid and fearful personality, Han is unwittingly drawn into the world of the 'Tasenda' club to repay the massive debt he incurred. There, he meets Jang Taesin, a man who is a perfect fit for the depths of darkness.
From the moment Taesin laid eyes on Han, he was inexplicably drawn to him and began to obsessively pursue him, offering a proposal to keep him from escaping.
"I'll stay by your side only until I get tired of you. Once I'm tired of your body, I'll consider your debt paid and let you go."
"How long will it take for you to get tired of me?"
"About twenty times, and I won't get tired."
However, instead of getting tired, the thirst only grew stronger.
He wanted to see, touch, and possess him. Once he had his body, he found himself desiring his heart as well.
"Why don't I ever get to see that cheap smile of yours?"
"You'll never see me smile in front of you, even if I die."
Taesin couldn't understand why Han hated him so much, and Han couldn't fathom Taesin's obsession with him.
Thus, the tangled threads of a complex relationship began to weave between the two, as distant from the end of the world as they could be. Can these two people, who seem so far apart from the rest of the world, really be together?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Jaemin went for an interview after hearing about a cleaning part-time job at the dentist's office. The doctor he met there, Lee Hyun, was extremely neat.
"Are you an omega?"
Why is he asking if I'm an omega?
Jaemin, who is not good at his job and lacks awareness, but is kind, becomes a cleaner on the day of the interview. The next day when Jaemin goes to the dentist's office, he stutters at the cold tone of Lee Hyun, which is different from yesterday.
"I'm a cleaner... part-time job. Temporary work. Three hours a day, twenty thousand won per hour."
"I told you this morning. The newly hired cleaning part-timer is so cute."
"Oh. Cleaning."
The only difference in appearance is the presence or absence of glasses between the twin brothers Ihyun and Ichan. Jaemin, unaware that he has fallen into their trap, works diligently, but soon realizes that something is wrong.
"I want to go home. Please let me go."

      <description><![CDATA[The man I had a drunken one-night stand with turned out to be the male lead from the original story. The issue? This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.
No! I don't want you to express it with your body either!]]></description>

After losing his mother, Jung-won loses his purpose as a doctor, until an offer arrives: keep Zion alive until the end of his world tour. "Don’t think of it as being a doctor; think of it as making money." 
He vowed that after three months, it wouldn’t matter if Zion swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills or slit his wrists in the bathtub. But—
“No doctor gives drugs to a patient like that.” “You said you weren’t a doctor.”
The moment I saw my fallen angel, drugged and limp in the sprawling castle hidden deep in the mountains, I knew I shouldn’t have come here.
“A doctor can’t turn away poor Zion.” “I refuse. I refuse… I absolutely refuse, Kim Zion.”
My patient. My Zion. He knew from the start. He knew I would never be able to turn him away. If only I’d known it would end like this, would I have been kinder to you?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.
After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor's chest: "Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?"
The new emperor kissed her: "You will be fine, just love me."
The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: "Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left."
When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess's obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official's wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.
Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.
------
The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.
Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.
For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, "The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated," before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. Blood poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.
When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.
Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: "Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?"
"... She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore."
Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: "She said she won't fight, so the fight is over?"

      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/the-wind-heard-her-confession/chapter-9-a-blinding-crush-part-1/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Synopsis: </span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin Yuran never would have thought that the client sitting across from her, forcing them both to work together, was the high school classmate she had rejected long ago, Chi Ye.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two maintained a distant yet courteous relationship, keeping their distance as they worked together.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Lin Yuran gradually felt something wasn't quite right.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, why did this man insist on her working at his company instead of her own studio? And moreover, how come her office just so happened to be directly opposite his?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another instance, when Lin Yuran accepted a ride in another man's Rolls-Royce Phantom, Chi Ye only sighed, "I thought I'd never get to ride a luxury car like this in my life."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The very next day, Chi Ye's car changed to a Bentley, then Bugatti, followed by Koenigsegg... Another time, Lin Yuran accidentally stumbled upon Chi Ye's Baidu profile and discovered that her favorite lollipop factory was registered under his name.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But rumor had it that the factory closed five years ago, and that some mysterious big shot loved eating these lollipops, so he bought the factory and continued production regardless of profit or loss, no matter what the situation.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous clues led Lin Yuran to suspect—</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chi Ye still liked her?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Little did she know, even their second encounter was part of his plan.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Chi Ye remained unaware that on that sweltering afternoon six years ago, Lin Yuran had quietly watched his lonely figure from afar and murmured softly, "If we meet again someday, I hope I can respond to you."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, only the wind heard her confession.</span>]]></description>

      <title>My Husband Became the Most Powerful Minister</title>
      <chaptername>Chapter 22</chaptername>
      <nameextend>"Miss Helan, let's discuss the marriage."</nameextend>
      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/my-husband-became-the-most-powerful-minister/chapter-22/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[At the princess's banquet, in a secluded hall, Helan Ci pressed her palm against the wall, encountering the equally disheveled newly crowned top scholar Lu Wuyou. One was as delicate as a willow, the other had a flushed face.
Their eyes met, and in each other's gaze, they saw a glimmer of despair.
"I'll go first..."
"I'll head that way..."
However, what was even more despairing was the sound of the princess's maid and the second prince's attendant searching for them not far away.
Helan Ci bit her lip: "What don't you just go to the princess?"
Lu Wuyou endured: "I think the second prince is not bad either."
Helan Ci: "If we keep talking, we'll only end up hurting each other!"
Lu Wuyou closed his eyes: "Then let it be a mutual destruction."
Helan Ci: "…?"
A night later, their innocence was lost, and they were forced into marriage. Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband's demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.
Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”
Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to. Who told me to marry you— I’m going to be a powerful minister. I can’t fall here.”
Helan Ci, “Then do your best! I’m counting on you!”
Lu Wuyou, “…?”
Years later, Lu Wuyou became the Prime Minister, holding the highest position among officials, wielding immense power across the land, and reflecting on the past.
A student asked him how he had come this far.
Prime Minister Lu thought to himself that as long as one marries a wife of extraordinary beauty, often coveted by others, it would always inspire one to strive to make progress.

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Li Suimei knew that Qin Qing would disdain to attend her engagement ceremony with Qin Zhan.
After all, as a vicious female supporting character, Li Suimei’s role as a stepping stone for the male and female leads was almost over.
Why would Qin Qing come to help her?
Li Suimei chuckled bitterly. She had heard rumors about Qin Qing being very protective of her loved ones, but she didn't know who had spread those rumors.
——At the engagement ceremony, Qin Qing, who was originally not supposed to attend, suddenly appeared. Wearing a snow-white wedding dress, she stood in the position that should have belonged to the male protagonist and said expressionlessly,
"Now, you are my wife."
Li Suimei: "..."
Didn't this person seem indifferent towards her just yesterday?
••••
Small Theater:
Qin Qing pinched Li Suimei's wrist, her gaze fierce, "Back then, I always thought, you invited me to dinner and movies, stayed up late with me to go through documents, hugged my arm and cried, calling me 'sister.' Whenever I got angry, you would get nervous, and you even walked in and out of my room in your pajamas. If that wasn't love, what was it?"
Li Suimei looked confused, "When did I bent?"
Qin Qing: "..."]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Lin Chu, an engineering student, was following a novel and found the villain character especially compelling. When she read the part where the villain was forced to marry a manipulative woman during his downfall, Lin Chu couldn’t help but criticize the green tea character.
Who would have expected that she’d black out, only to become that very same troublesome woman who regretted her marriage to the villain on their wedding day and ultimately got herself killed?
Lin Chu: “…”
Stay calm, don’t panic.
Looking at the villainous husband, injured and returning from the battlefield, Lin Chu thought she had found her chance to escape her tragic fate by clinging to his leg for survival…

      <title>Giving Interstellar Players a Horror Ghost Game Shock</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!
What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!
With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!
She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”
She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”
She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”
Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”
Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”

      <description><![CDATA[The little blind girl was stopped by a group of delinquents on the way home from school. The group of boys groped her breasts and even wanted to check if she was a virg*n. The little blind girl was so angry that she took out chili powder and sprayed it all over, then turned around and ran. She was completely lost and was almost hit by a car. One of the delinquents rushed over and hugged her, pointed at her and scolding in a loud voice, “Are you blind! Why did you run onto the road!”
&nbsp;
Yes, she was blind. The little blind girl burst into tears, her throat choking up, and the soft cloth on her eyes slipped off.
&nbsp;
The delinquent boy looked straight at her, “F*ck me?”
&nbsp;
“Let go… of me.” The little blind girl struggled against him.
&nbsp;
The delinquent boy looked at her pretty face and gulped, “What’s your name? Tell me, and I’ll let you go.”
&nbsp;
“…S-Su Ruan.” The little blind girl cried.
&nbsp;
“F*ck…” The delinquent boy l**ked the tip of his teeth and looked down at the tent in his pants. His voice had even become a little hoarse. “What a coincidence. My name is Hella Hard.”]]></description>

Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."

      <title>The Male Lead's Harem Belongs to Me (GL)</title>

      <nameextend/>
      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/the-male-leads-harem-belongs-to-me-gl/chapter-12/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Jiang Han died from staying up too late reading a novel, and after her death, she found herself transported into the ancient melodramatic romance novel she had been reading.
The male lead is a cold and domineering prince, and the female lead is the prince's long-cherished "white moonlight". Unfortunately, the white moonlight has a lowly status, and the prince's mother disapproves. The male lead goes to great lengths, enduring countless melodramatic events, heart-wrenching and physically exhausting, ultimately winning the heart of his beloved and achieving a happy ending. And Jiang Han is one of the cannon fodder female characters who, out of jealousy, targeted the male lead's white moonlight.
Jiang Han, who traveled through time, said: "No way, I just want to be a salted fish and play mahjong every day."
So when the male lead said: "I want to marry my white moonlight."
Jiang Han: Marry! You must marry! The gifts are all ready.
The male lead said: "She is timid and frail. As the princess, you should take good care of her."
Jiang Han: Take care! Must take care of !Tomorrow, I'll have her live next to me!
The male lead said: "She's too considerate. She won't speak up about her needs, so you should be more accommodating to her."
Jiang Han: Move! Must yield! Tomorrow, I will divorce you and give the title of princess to her!
••••
The next day, Jiang Han indeed handed him a divorce letter. The male lead, feeling complicated, signed it, but Jiang Han happily prepared to leave. Just as she reached the gate of the royal mansion, a group of concubines led by Bai Yueguang blocked her way.
Bai Yueguang: Sister Han, don't go. Would you stay?
A group of concubines: Yeah, yeah, please don't leave.
Jiang Han showed a troubled expression, and the male lead's heart was filled with joy. Just as he was about to say a few words of persuasion, he saw Jiang Han decisively shake her head.
The male lead thought it was a pity. Before he could catch his breath, he saw the person he held dear, his "white moonlight," take out a divorce agreement and coldly say to him, "Sign it. I want to leave with Sister Han."
The male lead stared wide-eyed in disbelief, a mouthful of old blood choked in his chest. However, the next moment, his group of concubines gritted their teeth and said to Bai Yueguang: "Weiwei, you are being too ungrateful. Why did you prepare the divorce papers all by yourself without telling us?"
#My harem seems to have turned into my princess's, what should I do#
#Is it too late to regret now#
One-on-one [highlight this], before the divorce, they were just pure revolutionary comrades and good friends. After the divorce, there will be romantic developments.]]></description>

      <title>After Marrying the Disabled Prince (BG)</title>

      <nameextend/>
      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/after-marrying-the-disabled-prince/chapter-10-sweetie/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[The fourth prince, Pei Yuan, was convicted overnight, falling from the title of the infamous King of Jibei to a paralyzed cripple.
The Duke of Rong’s household was unwilling to marry off their legitimate daughter, so the unloved Bao Ning was sent as a substitute bride.
The fourth prince's residence was nothing more than a broken-down courtyard on the capital's outskirts, covered in cobwebs and deserted. Pei Yuan, with a crippled leg, lay on the bed, filthy all over, glaring at her coldly with eyes full of vigilance and disgust.
Bao Ning, however, was delighted. Here, there were no scheming sisters or harsh mistresses. She could do whatever she wanted—raising chickens, planting vegetables and the two could live well enough.
As for this seemingly difficult-to-get-along-with disabled husband...
Bao Ning squatted beside Pei Yuan with a bowl of rice, looking at him eagerly. “I gave you all the meat. You should be a little nicer to me.”
In the struggle for the throne, the brothers turned against each other, and in one scheme, Pei Yuan was severely injured.
When he lay in bed with a crippled leg, he thought his life was over.
Unexpectedly, his newly married little wife suddenly broke into his life, fragrant and smiling, like a beam of light piercing through the mist.
How could he bear to only treat her a little better?
At their wedding, the dowry consisted of only three sacks of millet. Now, he offers the kingdom itself, just to make her smile.
<strong>Main characters:</strong> Ji Bao Ning and Pei Yuan
<strong>Warnings:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>The female lead is gentle and cute, skilled in cooking and crafting, with no scheming, and not a "strong woman" type.</li>
 	<li>The male lead can recover.</li>

      <description><![CDATA[The fourth prince, Pei Yuan, was convicted overnight, falling from the title of the infamous King of Jibei to a paralyzed cripple.
The Duke of Rong’s household was unwilling to marry off their legitimate daughter, so the unloved Bao Ning was sent as a substitute bride.
The fourth prince's residence was nothing more than a broken-down courtyard on the capital's outskirts, covered in cobwebs and deserted. Pei Yuan, with a crippled leg, lay on the bed, filthy all over, glaring at her coldly with eyes full of vigilance and disgust.
Bao Ning, however, was delighted. Here, there were no scheming sisters or harsh mistresses. She could do whatever she wanted—raising chickens, planting vegetables and the two could live well enough.
As for this seemingly difficult-to-get-along-with disabled husband...
Bao Ning squatted beside Pei Yuan with a bowl of rice, looking at him eagerly. “I gave you all the meat. You should be a little nicer to me.”
In the struggle for the throne, the brothers turned against each other, and in one scheme, Pei Yuan was severely injured.
When he lay in bed with a crippled leg, he thought his life was over.
Unexpectedly, his newly married little wife suddenly broke into his life, fragrant and smiling, like a beam of light piercing through the mist.
How could he bear to only treat her a little better?
At their wedding, the dowry consisted of only three sacks of millet. Now, he offers the kingdom itself, just to make her smile.
<strong>Main characters:</strong> Ji Bao Ning and Pei Yuan

From a young age, Rubel was called a saint due to her bond with the spirits and her immense magical prowess, drafted into countless battlefields. Yet when peace was finally achieved, her reward was an annulled engagement to the prince and a royal command: oversee the haunted Forest of Death, teeming with monstrous beasts, and marry the so-called “Barbarian Count,” a margrave of the frontier.
The Barbarian Count was said to be a man who spent his days battling monstrous creatures, obsessed with wealth, and reputed to be so terrifying in appearance that a mere glance could make someone faint.
But Rubel thought, Isn’t this a chance to fulfill my long-held dream of owning my own home?
After punching the prince goodbye, she set off alone for her final task, armed with just her staff and a single trunk, to wed the margrave of the frontier.
However, what awaited her was not the monstrous figure she had expected, but a breathtakingly handsome man with a villainous look that could make anyone weak at the knees.

In this world where magic reigns supreme, there's a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a 'stud' in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?]]></description>

---
The orphanage, engulfed in flames, was the only home Yeo-reum had ever known. Even as the fire raged, Yeo-reum ran back inside, desperate to find the director, only to encounter two unfamiliar brothers.
“Help… please, help me…”
“Call someone. They just left a kid behind.”
“But with a face like that, it’d be a waste.”
When Yeo-reum woke up, he found himself in the brothers’ home, unsure if he had been rescued or kidnapped. With nowhere else to go, he came to see them as his saviors and began a new life.
The concept of "family" felt foreign and complicated to Yeo-reum. But as he lived with the brothers, he slowly redefined what family meant, pouring his unwavering affection into them—unaware that his devotion only fueled their underlying unease. As time passed, their relationship grew into something inexplicably intense and tangled.

      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/with-multiple-babies-who-still-wants-to-be-the-marquesss-wife/chapter-32/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Everyone in the capital knew that the Marquess’s wife, Lan Qingxi, was despised by her in-laws, abused by her mother-in-law, and merely a plaything of the treacherous Song Linyuan. People expected her to be divorced, thrown into a pond, and abandoned, ending up in a pitiful state. But one day, when Lan Qingxi was about to leave the Marquess’s residence, Song Linyuan waited at the door, wiping the dust from her shoes, carefully helping her into the bridal sedan, and leading a procession to marry her. That’s when everyone realized they had misjudged the situation.
After their marriage, Song Linyuan said, “Madam, it’s rumored in the capital that I fear my wife.”
Lan Qingxi innocently replied, “Who has the audacity to spread such rumors about the Prime Minister? Drag them out and execute them.”
Song Linyuan: “I did.”
Lan Qingxi: “……”
Lan Qingxi’s saying: Successfully performing in front of a scumbag is called lying. Successfully performing in front of Song Linyuan is called winning at life.

      <description><![CDATA[The man I had a drunken one-night stand with turned out to be the male lead from the original story. The issue? This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.
No! I don't want you to express it with your body either!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.
After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor's chest: "Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?"
The new emperor kissed her: "You will be fine, just love me."
The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: "Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left."
When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess's obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official's wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.
Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.
------
The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.
Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.
For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, "The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated," before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. Blood poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.
When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.
Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: "Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?"
"... She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore."
Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: "She said she won't fight, so the fight is over?"

When she read the part where the villain was forced to marry a manipulative woman during his downfall, Lin Chu couldn’t help but criticize the green tea character.
Who would have expected that she’d black out, only to become that very same troublesome woman who regretted her marriage to the villain on their wedding day and ultimately got herself killed?
Lin Chu: “…”
Stay calm, don’t panic.
Looking at the villainous husband, injured and returning from the battlefield, Lin Chu thought she had found her chance to escape her tragic fate by clinging to his leg for survival…

After losing his mother, Jung-won loses his purpose as a doctor, until an offer arrives: keep Zion alive until the end of his world tour. "Don’t think of it as being a doctor; think of it as making money." 
He vowed that after three months, it wouldn’t matter if Zion swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills or slit his wrists in the bathtub. But—
“No doctor gives drugs to a patient like that.” “You said you weren’t a doctor.”
The moment I saw my fallen angel, drugged and limp in the sprawling castle hidden deep in the mountains, I knew I shouldn’t have come here.
“A doctor can’t turn away poor Zion.” “I refuse. I refuse… I absolutely refuse, Kim Zion.”
My patient. My Zion. He knew from the start. He knew I would never be able to turn him away. If only I’d known it would end like this, would I have been kinder to you?]]></description>

From a young age, Rubel was called a saint due to her bond with the spirits and her immense magical prowess, drafted into countless battlefields. Yet when peace was finally achieved, her reward was an annulled engagement to the prince and a royal command: oversee the haunted Forest of Death, teeming with monstrous beasts, and marry the so-called “Barbarian Count,” a margrave of the frontier.
The Barbarian Count was said to be a man who spent his days battling monstrous creatures, obsessed with wealth, and reputed to be so terrifying in appearance that a mere glance could make someone faint.
But Rubel thought, Isn’t this a chance to fulfill my long-held dream of owning my own home?
After punching the prince goodbye, she set off alone for her final task, armed with just her staff and a single trunk, to wed the margrave of the frontier.
However, what awaited her was not the monstrous figure she had expected, but a breathtakingly handsome man with a villainous look that could make anyone weak at the knees.
What was meant to be a marriage in name only soon proved otherwise—her husband was kind, his domain awe-inspiring, and...]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[After drinking too much at my retirement celebration, I woke up to find myself inexplicably transformed into a beautiful young boy in another world. In this world where magic reigns supreme, there's a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a 'stud' in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Klaus, who was on the verge of death due to a high fever, met a goddess and was specially granted the ‘Hatching’ skill. When he regained consciousness, he found himself lying in bed surrounded by his parents and his younger sister, Celia.
Later, after various events, Klaus became an adventurer and discovered a large egg deep in the forest. When he hatched it, a phoenix emerged. For some reason, a familiar contract was automatically formed, along with the bonus of being able to use some of the familiar's abilities.

      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/the-young-marquis-regrets-too-late/chapter-18/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.
Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.
Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.
Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.
The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…
The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.
That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.
<hr />
Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.
Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.
At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.
He could smile, she realised, but not for her.
From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.
Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.
<hr />
After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.
But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.
On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”
Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”
Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.
For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!
What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!
With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!
She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”
She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”
She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”
Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”
Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”

      <title>The Female Lead is Looking at Me Differently (GL)</title>

      <nameextend/>
      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/the-female-lead-is-looking-at-me-differently/chapter-20/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Wen Zhao transmigrated into a low-magic Xianxia novel, only to discover she'd become the cannon fodder second female lead who bullied the female lead, seduced the male lead, and was generally a green tea b*tch, lotus-flower-like antagonist.
In the original novel, she was the catalyst for misunderstandings between the male and female leads, a dedicated tool character who lived until the grand finale. In the end, the male and female leads ended up together, while she suffered the consequences.
To avoid a bad ending, Wen Zhao tried her best to cling to the female lead without being too out of character, hoping to safely exit the story.
Although she was still being required by the system to perform actions befitting a second female lead, Wen Zhao believed the female lead would eventually understand her sincere heart!
However, it seemed like the female lead was looking at her a bit strangely?
••••
Male Lead: A Zhao, I suddenly realized that I might actually like you a little.
Wen Zhao: ???
She thought this was the biggest deviation from the plot, but then the female lead slowly approached.
Lowering her gaze slightly, the female lead, whose gaze was usually cold, revealed a hint of obsession and possessiveness. She walked up to Wen Zhao and smiled softly.
She asked softly, "A Zhao, between him and me, who do you choose?"
Wen Zhao: I choose you! I choose you!
••••
One-Sentence Summary: Thank you everyone, I'm with the female lead now.
Theme: Even when facing difficulties, one should strive to overcome them and have the determination to reverse their situation. Only through hard work can one achieve success. Victory and new surprises are waiting not far away.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[To survive, Sheng Nuan must traverse different worlds, playing the role of self-destructive cannon fodder while saving the darkest villains. These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand. Holding the cannon fodder's script, Sheng Nuan is terrified...
Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

      <description><![CDATA[Everyone in the capital knew that the Marquess’s wife, Lan Qingxi, was despised by her in-laws, abused by her mother-in-law, and merely a plaything of the treacherous Song Linyuan. People expected her to be divorced, thrown into a pond, and abandoned, ending up in a pitiful state. But one day, when Lan Qingxi was about to leave the Marquess’s residence, Song Linyuan waited at the door, wiping the dust from her shoes, carefully helping her into the bridal sedan, and leading a procession to marry her. That’s when everyone realized they had misjudged the situation.
After their marriage, Song Linyuan said, “Madam, it’s rumored in the capital that I fear my wife.”
Lan Qingxi innocently replied, “Who has the audacity to spread such rumors about the Prime Minister? Drag them out and execute them.”
Song Linyuan: “I did.”
Lan Qingxi: “……”
Lan Qingxi’s saying: Successfully performing in front of a scumbag is called lying. Successfully performing in front of Song Linyuan is called winning at life.

      <description><![CDATA[The man I had a drunken one-night stand with turned out to be the male lead from the original story. The issue? This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.
No! I don't want you to express it with your body either!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Gu Yu Qi, a daughter born to a marquis household. She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky. It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.
But what happened to her in the end?
For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.
If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.
Who knew he’d be reborn again…

      <description><![CDATA[To survive, Sheng Nuan must traverse different worlds, playing the role of self-destructive cannon fodder while saving the darkest villains. These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand. Holding the cannon fodder's script, Sheng Nuan is terrified...
Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

      <description><![CDATA[Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.
After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor's chest: "Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?"
The new emperor kissed her: "You will be fine, just love me."
The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: "Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left."
When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess's obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official's wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.
Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.
------
The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.
Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.
For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, "The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated," before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. Blood poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.
When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.
Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: "Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?"
"... She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore."
Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: "She said she won't fight, so the fight is over?"

      <description><![CDATA[Be kind to the "target" to avoid condemnation?
Use your "knowledge of otome games" to live as a commoner in hiding?
...Pathetic.
Find a lover better than your fiancé and have them take revenge?
--Leaving your fate in the hands of others is utterly laughable.
Friendship and love are unnecessary. If it's for revenge, I'll bow my head, but I will always crush them all later, without fail.
This is the story of Gloria, a villainous noblewoman who is wholly dedicated to revenge.
Gloria, of the Duke of Caldwell's family, was accused of injuring the saint who had received the crown prince's true love at her graduation party. Then, she was framed for another crime she didn't commit and was executed. She died cursing everything in this world that had wronged her, but when she woke up, she was ten years old again, revived.
At the same time, a ghost from another world appeared, saying, "This is the world of otome games, and Gloria is a villainous lady." But instead of ignoring it, she made the ghost submit and decided to live her second life solely for revenge.

      <description><![CDATA[Jaemin went for an interview after hearing about a cleaning part-time job at the dentist's office. The doctor he met there, Lee Hyun, was extremely neat.
"Are you an omega?"
Why is he asking if I'm an omega?
Jaemin, who is not good at his job and lacks awareness, but is kind, becomes a cleaner on the day of the interview. The next day when Jaemin goes to the dentist's office, he stutters at the cold tone of Lee Hyun, which is different from yesterday.
"I'm a cleaner... part-time job. Temporary work. Three hours a day, twenty thousand won per hour."
"I told you this morning. The newly hired cleaning part-timer is so cute."
"Oh. Cleaning."
The only difference in appearance is the presence or absence of glasses between the twin brothers Ihyun and Ichan. Jaemin, unaware that he has fallen into their trap, works diligently, but soon realizes that something is wrong.
"I want to go home. Please let me go."

      <description><![CDATA["Every day, a recurring hellish dream. Junseong is stuck in a world that feels like an endless loop, much like a roguelike game. It's a cursed world where he struggles every day. Two months have passed since he set foot in the zombie apocalypse world in his dreams. "Ha...." As soon as he woke up, his gaze was instinctively drawn to the internet broadcast that he habitually left on. -A major riot is occurring in some regions due to the current situation... Then, beep! A loud sound announcing a disaster alert echoed in Junseong's head. Unconsciously picking up his phone along with the alarm sound, Junseong couldn't hide his confused expression.
[10:44 AM] It was the exact time he had always woken up in his dream. Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. "I've been wanting to ask you something."
"What?" As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo's gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. "Why do you look at me like that?" Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. "How am I... looking at you?"
"...." Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the 'fake smile' he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of blood was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of blood from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his 'clothes' but emanated from him.``]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[*This story contains themes of coercive relationships and uncomfortable subjects.
A child was on the way.
We loved each other, were happy together, and dreamed of a future as a family.
But on the way to the obstetrician to meet the baby, an unexpected accident occurred.
Due to the accident, Dokwon didn't open his eyes for a long time, and when he finally came to...
"Omega?"
He didn't remember me.
But I was okay. We loved each other more than anything. I believed without a doubt that we could return to that time.
Dokwon's words hurt, but I could endure it. I could bear it.
"You'll regret this."
"Me? What will I regret?"
"Talking to me like that."
"What?"
"Treating me poorly. Treating me like a gold digger. Seeing me as an empty-headed omega who only emits pheromones. You'll regret it later."
But the world relentlessly pushed us to the edge.
And finally,
"Let's end this here."
"...What?"
"Get rid of the baby."
"...What did you say?"
"Let's end this without causing any more disgrace. Eunsoo Yoo."
The end tore us apart.
Left standing alone at the end... I fervently wished for death.]]></description>

"...Ah, I got it right this time? Yeah, I'll use this for my fiancé. What of it?" Ian's voice continued soothingly. "Even if I just torment him a little, that young master will run off crying to his daddy. If he's an alpha, he might even be traumatized."
In this world, is this a dream or reality? Is my fiancé now buying adult toys from my favorite club just to torment me? That sounded far more alluring and sweet than any love confession Noah had ever heard. Noah immediately changed the resolve he had just made to not marry Ian Miller. Someone who would even pluck a star from the sky for him is nothing special, and someone who hates him is nothing special either, but someone who will torment him is most welcome. This marriage must happen! It absolutely must! The delusion and love between a lovable, cute masochist and a lone, serious bad guy!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[At the princess's banquet, in a secluded hall, Helan Ci pressed her palm against the wall, encountering the equally disheveled newly crowned top scholar Lu Wuyou. One was as delicate as a willow, the other had a flushed face.
Their eyes met, and in each other's gaze, they saw a glimmer of despair.
"I'll go first..."
"I'll head that way..."
However, what was even more despairing was the sound of the princess's maid and the second prince's attendant searching for them not far away.
Helan Ci bit her lip: "What don't you just go to the princess?"
Lu Wuyou endured: "I think the second prince is not bad either."
Helan Ci: "If we keep talking, we'll only end up hurting each other!"
Lu Wuyou closed his eyes: "Then let it be a mutual destruction."
Helan Ci: "…?"
A night later, their innocence was lost, and they were forced into marriage. Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband's demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.
Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”
Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to. Who told me to marry you— I’m going to be a powerful minister. I can’t fall here.”
Helan Ci, “Then do your best! I’m counting on you!”
Lu Wuyou, “…?”
Years later, Lu Wuyou became the Prime Minister, holding the highest position among officials, wielding immense power across the land, and reflecting on the past.
A student asked him how he had come this far.
Prime Minister Lu thought to himself that as long as one marries a wife of extraordinary beauty, often coveted by others, it would always inspire one to strive to make progress.

      <description><![CDATA[※ This work contains immoral subject matter, violent acts, and descriptions of coercive relationships, among other things. Additionally, the settings, backgrounds, and characters in the work are all fictional. Please keep this in mind while enjoying the story.
Han's simple daily life working part-time at a convenience store is suddenly turned upside down.
"Your debt amounts to a total of one hundred million and seven thousand."
With a timid and fearful personality, Han is unwittingly drawn into the world of the 'Tasenda' club to repay the massive debt he incurred. There, he meets Jang Taesin, a man who is a perfect fit for the depths of darkness.
From the moment Taesin laid eyes on Han, he was inexplicably drawn to him and began to obsessively pursue him, offering a proposal to keep him from escaping.
"I'll stay by your side only until I get tired of you. Once I'm tired of your body, I'll consider your debt paid and let you go."
"How long will it take for you to get tired of me?"
"About twenty times, and I won't get tired."
However, instead of getting tired, the thirst only grew stronger.
He wanted to see, touch, and possess him. Once he had his body, he found himself desiring his heart as well.
"Why don't I ever get to see that cheap smile of yours?"
"You'll never see me smile in front of you, even if I die."
Taesin couldn't understand why Han hated him so much, and Han couldn't fathom Taesin's obsession with him.
Thus, the tangled threads of a complex relationship began to weave between the two, as distant from the end of the world as they could be. Can these two people, who seem so far apart from the rest of the world, really be together?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Jung-won, born the son of a prostitute and now a doctor. Zion, molded into a top star by his father from birth. After losing his mother, Jung-won loses his purpose as a doctor, until an offer arrives: keep Zion alive until the end of his world tour. "Don’t think of it as being a doctor; think of it as making money." 
He vowed that after three months, it wouldn’t matter if Zion swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills or slit his wrists in the bathtub. But—
“No doctor gives drugs to a patient like that.” “You said you weren’t a doctor.”
The moment I saw my fallen angel, drugged and limp in the sprawling castle hidden deep in the mountains, I knew I shouldn’t have come here.
“A doctor can’t turn away poor Zion.” “I refuse. I refuse… I absolutely refuse, Kim Zion.”
My patient. My Zion. He knew from the start. He knew I would never be able to turn him away. If only I’d known it would end like this, would I have been kinder to you?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[To survive, Sheng Nuan must traverse different worlds, playing the role of self-destructive cannon fodder while saving the darkest villains. These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand. Holding the cannon fodder's script, Sheng Nuan is terrified...
Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

      <description><![CDATA["A Marriage in Name Only, Yet 'My Wife' and 'My Husband' Are Too Perfect!"
From a young age, Rubel was called a saint due to her bond with the spirits and her immense magical prowess, drafted into countless battlefields. Yet when peace was finally achieved, her reward was an annulled engagement to the prince and a royal command: oversee the haunted Forest of Death, teeming with monstrous beasts, and marry the so-called “Barbarian Count,” a margrave of the frontier.
The Barbarian Count was said to be a man who spent his days battling monstrous creatures, obsessed with wealth, and reputed to be so terrifying in appearance that a mere glance could make someone faint.
But Rubel thought, Isn’t this a chance to fulfill my long-held dream of owning my own home?
After punching the prince goodbye, she set off alone for her final task, armed with just her staff and a single trunk, to wed the margrave of the frontier.
However, what awaited her was not the monstrous figure she had expected, but a breathtakingly handsome man with a villainous look that could make anyone weak at the knees.
What was meant to be a marriage in name only soon proved otherwise—her husband was kind, his domain awe-inspiring, and...]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Synopsis: </span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin Yuran never would have thought that the client sitting across from her, forcing them both to work together, was the high school classmate she had rejected long ago, Chi Ye.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two maintained a distant yet courteous relationship, keeping their distance as they worked together.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Lin Yuran gradually felt something wasn't quite right.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, why did this man insist on her working at his company instead of her own studio? And moreover, how come her office just so happened to be directly opposite his?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another instance, when Lin Yuran accepted a ride in another man's Rolls-Royce Phantom, Chi Ye only sighed, "I thought I'd never get to ride a luxury car like this in my life."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The very next day, Chi Ye's car changed to a Bentley, then Bugatti, followed by Koenigsegg... Another time, Lin Yuran accidentally stumbled upon Chi Ye's Baidu profile and discovered that her favorite lollipop factory was registered under his name.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But rumor had it that the factory closed five years ago, and that some mysterious big shot loved eating these lollipops, so he bought the factory and continued production regardless of profit or loss, no matter what the situation.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous clues led Lin Yuran to suspect—</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chi Ye still liked her?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Little did she know, even their second encounter was part of his plan.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Chi Ye remained unaware that on that sweltering afternoon six years ago, Lin Yuran had quietly watched his lonely figure from afar and murmured softly, "If we meet again someday, I hope I can respond to you."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, only the wind heard her confession.</span>]]></description>

      <nameextend>"...Then let it be a mutual destruction."</nameextend>
      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/my-husband-became-the-most-powerful-minister/chapter-20/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[At the princess's banquet, in a secluded hall, Helan Ci pressed her palm against the wall, encountering the equally disheveled newly crowned top scholar Lu Wuyou. One was as delicate as a willow, the other had a flushed face.
Their eyes met, and in each other's gaze, they saw a glimmer of despair.
"I'll go first..."
"I'll head that way..."
However, what was even more despairing was the sound of the princess's maid and the second prince's attendant searching for them not far away.
Helan Ci bit her lip: "What don't you just go to the princess?"
Lu Wuyou endured: "I think the second prince is not bad either."
Helan Ci: "If we keep talking, we'll only end up hurting each other!"
Lu Wuyou closed his eyes: "Then let it be a mutual destruction."
Helan Ci: "…?"
A night later, their innocence was lost, and they were forced into marriage. Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband's demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.
Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”
Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to. Who told me to marry you— I’m going to be a powerful minister. I can’t fall here.”
Helan Ci, “Then do your best! I’m counting on you!”
Lu Wuyou, “…?”
Years later, Lu Wuyou became the Prime Minister, holding the highest position among officials, wielding immense power across the land, and reflecting on the past.
A student asked him how he had come this far.
Prime Minister Lu thought to himself that as long as one marries a wife of extraordinary beauty, often coveted by others, it would always inspire one to strive to make progress.

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!
What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!
With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!
She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”
She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”
She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”
Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”
Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”

When she read the part where the villain was forced to marry a manipulative woman during his downfall, Lin Chu couldn’t help but criticize the green tea character.
Who would have expected that she’d black out, only to become that very same troublesome woman who regretted her marriage to the villain on their wedding day and ultimately got herself killed?
Lin Chu: “…”
Stay calm, don’t panic.
Looking at the villainous husband, injured and returning from the battlefield, Lin Chu thought she had found her chance to escape her tragic fate by clinging to his leg for survival…

      <title>Giving Interstellar Players a Horror Ghost Game Shock</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!
What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!
With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!
She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”
She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”
She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”
Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”
Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”

      <description><![CDATA[Jung-won, born the son of a prostitute and now a doctor. Zion, molded into a top star by his father from birth. After losing his mother, Jung-won loses his purpose as a doctor, until an offer arrives: keep Zion alive until the end of his world tour. "Don’t think of it as being a doctor; think of it as making money." 
He vowed that after three months, it wouldn’t matter if Zion swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills or slit his wrists in the bathtub. But—
“No doctor gives drugs to a patient like that.” “You said you weren’t a doctor.”
The moment I saw my fallen angel, drugged and limp in the sprawling castle hidden deep in the mountains, I knew I shouldn’t have come here.
“A doctor can’t turn away poor Zion.” “I refuse. I refuse… I absolutely refuse, Kim Zion.”
My patient. My Zion. He knew from the start. He knew I would never be able to turn him away. If only I’d known it would end like this, would I have been kinder to you?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The little blind girl was stopped by a group of delinquents on the way home from school. The group of boys groped her breasts and even wanted to check if she was a virg*n. The little blind girl was so angry that she took out chili powder and sprayed it all over, then turned around and ran. She was completely lost and was almost hit by a car. One of the delinquents rushed over and hugged her, pointed at her and scolding in a loud voice, “Are you blind! Why did you run onto the road!”
&nbsp;
Yes, she was blind. The little blind girl burst into tears, her throat choking up, and the soft cloth on her eyes slipped off.
&nbsp;
The delinquent boy looked straight at her, “F*ck me?”

“Let go… of me.” The little blind girl struggled against him.
&nbsp;
The delinquent boy looked at her pretty face and gulped, “What’s your name? Tell me, and I’ll let you go.”
&nbsp;
“…S-Su Ruan.” The little blind girl cried.
&nbsp;
“F*ck…” The delinquent boy l**ked the tip of his teeth and looked down at the tent in his pants. His voice had even become a little hoarse. “What a coincidence. My name is Hella Hard.”]]></description>

Later:
A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."

      <title>After Marrying the Disabled Prince (BG)</title>

      <nameextend/>
      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/after-marrying-the-disabled-prince/chapter-9-rascal/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[The fourth prince, Pei Yuan, was convicted overnight, falling from the title of the infamous King of Jibei to a paralyzed cripple.
The Duke of Rong’s household was unwilling to marry off their legitimate daughter, so the unloved Bao Ning was sent as a substitute bride.
The fourth prince's residence was nothing more than a broken-down courtyard on the capital's outskirts, covered in cobwebs and deserted. Pei Yuan, with a crippled leg, lay on the bed, filthy all over, glaring at her coldly with eyes full of vigilance and disgust.
Bao Ning, however, was delighted. Here, there were no scheming sisters or harsh mistresses. She could do whatever she wanted—raising chickens, planting vegetables and the two could live well enough.
As for this seemingly difficult-to-get-along-with disabled husband...
Bao Ning squatted beside Pei Yuan with a bowl of rice, looking at him eagerly. “I gave you all the meat. You should be a little nicer to me.”
In the struggle for the throne, the brothers turned against each other, and in one scheme, Pei Yuan was severely injured.
When he lay in bed with a crippled leg, he thought his life was over.
Unexpectedly, his newly married little wife suddenly broke into his life, fragrant and smiling, like a beam of light piercing through the mist.
How could he bear to only treat her a little better?
At their wedding, the dowry consisted of only three sacks of millet. Now, he offers the kingdom itself, just to make her smile.
<strong>Main characters:</strong> Ji Bao Ning and Pei Yuan
<strong>Warnings:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>The female lead is gentle and cute, skilled in cooking and crafting, with no scheming, and not a "strong woman" type.</li>
 	<li>The male lead can recover.</li>
 	<li>The male lead has a rugged, bandit-like personality, not a gentle-type prince.</li>

      <description><![CDATA[After drinking too much at my retirement celebration, I woke up to find myself inexplicably transformed into a beautiful young boy in another world. In this world where magic reigns supreme, there's a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a 'stud' in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<strong>This work contains themes of gaslighting, coercion, and other morally challenging topics. Please be aware of this when engaging with the story.</strong>
---
The orphanage, engulfed in flames, was the only home Yeo-reum had ever known. Even as the fire raged, Yeo-reum ran back inside, desperate to find the director, only to encounter two unfamiliar brothers.
“Help… please, help me…”
“Call someone. They just left a kid behind.”
“But with a face like that, it’d be a waste.”
When Yeo-reum woke up, he found himself in the brothers’ home, unsure if he had been rescued or kidnapped. With nowhere else to go, he came to see them as his saviors and began a new life.
The concept of "family" felt foreign and complicated to Yeo-reum. But as he lived with the brothers, he slowly redefined what family meant, pouring his unwavering affection into them—unaware that his devotion only fueled their underlying unease. As time passed, their relationship grew into something inexplicably intense and tangled.

      <description><![CDATA[The man I had a drunken one-night stand with turned out to be the male lead from the original story. The issue? This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.
No! I don't want you to express it with your body either!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.
After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor's chest: "Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?"
The new emperor kissed her: "You will be fine, just love me."
The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: "Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left."
When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess's obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official's wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.
Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.
------
The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.
Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.
For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, "The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated," before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. Blood poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.
When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.
Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: "Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?"
"... She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore."
Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: "She said she won't fight, so the fight is over?"

      <description><![CDATA[Jung-won, born the son of a prostitute and now a doctor. Zion, molded into a top star by his father from birth. After losing his mother, Jung-won loses his purpose as a doctor, until an offer arrives: keep Zion alive until the end of his world tour. "Don’t think of it as being a doctor; think of it as making money." 
He vowed that after three months, it wouldn’t matter if Zion swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills or slit his wrists in the bathtub. But—
“No doctor gives drugs to a patient like that.” “You said you weren’t a doctor.”
The moment I saw my fallen angel, drugged and limp in the sprawling castle hidden deep in the mountains, I knew I shouldn’t have come here.
“A doctor can’t turn away poor Zion.” “I refuse. I refuse… I absolutely refuse, Kim Zion.”
My patient. My Zion. He knew from the start. He knew I would never be able to turn him away. If only I’d known it would end like this, would I have been kinder to you?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">불가혼 means incompatible. In the prospects of matrimony, it means unmarriageable.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summary–</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kang Yeon-hong, the noble daughter of Minister Kang, is no longer the cherished young lady she once was, her aristocratic status now a mere facade. One day, she is abducted and sold to the renowned noble, Kwon Gu-yong, in Hanyang, under the condition that she rears a child for the prestigious Kwon family.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Facing a humiliating fate, she attempts to escape, only to be stopped by a man who resembles an old lover, holding her tightly. This was the man who once loved her with his life, the one who supposedly died during the tragic fall of his household.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The man shook his head in annoyance. It seemed like he was disinterested in her petty grievances, clicking his tongue, as if in contempt. His gaze darkened with disdain.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I don’t know who you think I am, let me make one thing clear."</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">He pried her hands away and spoke.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I’ve never met a woman like you."</span></i>
&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Character Guide</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Male Lead: Heo Nan-woo</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A guest and a resident at the household of Minister Kang</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Despite his lowly social status, he was taken in as a guest and a master of Go</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to his innate genius at the game. Having lived a life devoid of desires, he’s met with a fatal crisis when he begins to covet Young Lady</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yeon-hong. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After five years, he is reborn in Hanyang (present-day Seoul) as Kwon Si-gyeong, the eldest son of one of the most prestigious families in the capital. He had confidence that he had completely forgotten his past, but it was mere arrogance. What lingered could be a thirst for revenge or a tangled mix of love and hatred.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Female Lead: Kang Yeon-hong</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A cherished noble lady who was raised like a precious gem. Strong-willed and stubborn, she’s always had her way. Having lived a life of luxury, she suddenly finds herself agonising over an intense longing for a lowly household guest — without even realizing it could be love.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the happiest moment of her life, she loses everything. As she writhes in one hell, another abyss beckons her.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Hate me all you want. I will never let you go. Never."</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A story of love, hatred, and revenge that transcends social status.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatable quotes: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Even a dog doesn’t bite the hand that raised it. How much more so should a person repay kindness?"</span></i>]]></description>

Yet when peace was finally achieved, her reward was an annulled engagement to the prince and a royal command: oversee the haunted Forest of Death, teeming with monstrous beasts, and marry the so-called “Barbarian Count,” a margrave of the frontier.
The Barbarian Count was said to be a man who spent his days battling monstrous creatures, obsessed with wealth, and reputed to be so terrifying in appearance that a mere glance could make someone faint.
But Rubel thought, Isn’t this a chance to fulfill my long-held dream of owning my own home?
After punching the prince goodbye, she set off alone for her final task, armed with just her staff and a single trunk, to wed the margrave of the frontier.
However, what awaited her was not the monstrous figure she had expected, but a breathtakingly handsome man with a villainous look that could make anyone weak at the knees.
What was meant to be a marriage in name only soon proved otherwise—her husband was kind, his domain awe-inspiring, and...]]></description>

      <title>The Male Lead's Harem Belongs to Me (GL)</title>
      <chaptername>Chapter 11</chaptername>

      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/the-male-leads-harem-belongs-to-me-gl/chapter-11/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Jiang Han died from staying up too late reading a novel, and after her death, she found herself transported into the ancient melodramatic romance novel she had been reading.
The male lead is a cold and domineering prince, and the female lead is the prince's long-cherished "white moonlight". Unfortunately, the white moonlight has a lowly status, and the prince's mother disapproves. The male lead goes to great lengths, enduring countless melodramatic events, heart-wrenching and physically exhausting, ultimately winning the heart of his beloved and achieving a happy ending. And Jiang Han is one of the cannon fodder female characters who, out of jealousy, targeted the male lead's white moonlight.
Jiang Han, who traveled through time, said: "No way, I just want to be a salted fish and play mahjong every day."
So when the male lead said: "I want to marry my white moonlight."
Jiang Han: Marry! You must marry! The gifts are all ready.
The male lead said: "She is timid and frail. As the princess, you should take good care of her."
Jiang Han: Take care! Must take care of !Tomorrow, I'll have her live next to me!
The male lead said: "She's too considerate. She won't speak up about her needs, so you should be more accommodating to her."
Jiang Han: Move! Must yield! Tomorrow, I will divorce you and give the title of princess to her!
••••
The next day, Jiang Han indeed handed him a divorce letter. The male lead, feeling complicated, signed it, but Jiang Han happily prepared to leave. Just as she reached the gate of the royal mansion, a group of concubines led by Bai Yueguang blocked her way.
Bai Yueguang: Sister Han, don't go. Would you stay?
A group of concubines: Yeah, yeah, please don't leave.
Jiang Han showed a troubled expression, and the male lead's heart was filled with joy. Just as he was about to say a few words of persuasion, he saw Jiang Han decisively shake her head.
The male lead thought it was a pity. Before he could catch his breath, he saw the person he held dear, his "white moonlight," take out a divorce agreement and coldly say to him, "Sign it. I want to leave with Sister Han."
The male lead stared wide-eyed in disbelief, a mouthful of old blood choked in his chest. However, the next moment, his group of concubines gritted their teeth and said to Bai Yueguang: "Weiwei, you are being too ungrateful. Why did you prepare the divorce papers all by yourself without telling us?"
#My harem seems to have turned into my princess's, what should I do#
#Is it too late to regret now#
One-on-one [highlight this], before the divorce, they were just pure revolutionary comrades and good friends. After the divorce, there will be romantic developments.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Lin Chu, an engineering student, was following a novel and found the villain character especially compelling. When she read the part where the villain was forced to marry a manipulative woman during his downfall, Lin Chu couldn’t help but criticize the green tea character.
Who would have expected that she’d black out, only to become that very same troublesome woman who regretted her marriage to the villain on their wedding day and ultimately got herself killed?
Lin Chu: “…”
Stay calm, don’t panic.
Looking at the villainous husband, injured and returning from the battlefield, Lin Chu thought she had found her chance to escape her tragic fate by clinging to his leg for survival…

The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."

In this world where magic reigns supreme, there's a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a 'stud' in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.
Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.
Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.
Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.
The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…
The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.
That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.
<hr />
Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.
Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.
At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.
He could smile, she realised, but not for her.
From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.
Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.
<hr />
After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.
But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.
On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”
Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”
Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.
For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.]]></description>

Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!
What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!
With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!
She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”
She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”
She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”
Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”
Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”

      <description><![CDATA[The man I had a drunken one-night stand with turned out to be the male lead from the original story. The issue? This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.
No! I don't want you to express it with your body either!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Wen Zhao transmigrated into a low-magic Xianxia novel, only to discover she'd become the cannon fodder second female lead who bullied the female lead, seduced the male lead, and was generally a green tea b*tch, lotus-flower-like antagonist.
In the original novel, she was the catalyst for misunderstandings between the male and female leads, a dedicated tool character who lived until the grand finale. In the end, the male and female leads ended up together, while she suffered the consequences.
To avoid a bad ending, Wen Zhao tried her best to cling to the female lead without being too out of character, hoping to safely exit the story.
Although she was still being required by the system to perform actions befitting a second female lead, Wen Zhao believed the female lead would eventually understand her sincere heart!
However, it seemed like the female lead was looking at her a bit strangely?
••••
Male Lead: A Zhao, I suddenly realized that I might actually like you a little.
Wen Zhao: ???
She thought this was the biggest deviation from the plot, but then the female lead slowly approached.
Lowering her gaze slightly, the female lead, whose gaze was usually cold, revealed a hint of obsession and possessiveness. She walked up to Wen Zhao and smiled softly.
She asked softly, "A Zhao, between him and me, who do you choose?"
Wen Zhao: I choose you! I choose you!
••••
One-Sentence Summary: Thank you everyone, I'm with the female lead now.
Theme: Even when facing difficulties, one should strive to overcome them and have the determination to reverse their situation. Only through hard work can one achieve success. Victory and new surprises are waiting not far away.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.
After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor's chest: "Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?"
The new emperor kissed her: "You will be fine, just love me."
The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: "Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left."
When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess's obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official's wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.
Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.
------
The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.
Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.
For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, "The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated," before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. Blood poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.
When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.
Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: "Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?"
"... She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore."
Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: "She said she won't fight, so the fight is over?"

      <description><![CDATA[At the princess's banquet, in a secluded hall, Helan Ci pressed her palm against the wall, encountering the equally disheveled newly crowned top scholar Lu Wuyou. One was as delicate as a willow, the other had a flushed face.
Their eyes met, and in each other's gaze, they saw a glimmer of despair.
"I'll go first..."
"I'll head that way..."
However, what was even more despairing was the sound of the princess's maid and the second prince's attendant searching for them not far away.
Helan Ci bit her lip: "What don't you just go to the princess?"
Lu Wuyou endured: "I think the second prince is not bad either."
Helan Ci: "If we keep talking, we'll only end up hurting each other!"
Lu Wuyou closed his eyes: "Then let it be a mutual destruction."
Helan Ci: "…?"
A night later, their innocence was lost, and they were forced into marriage. Yet, with strong enemies lurking, this marriage was extremely difficult. On one side, there was the second prince, eagerly awaiting her husband's demise, and on the other, the princess, watching her with cold eyes.
Helan Ci asked, “…Can you handle this?”
Lu Wuyou replied, “Even if I can’t, I have to. Who told me to marry you— I’m going to be a powerful minister. I can’t fall here.”
Helan Ci, “Then do your best! I’m counting on you!”
Lu Wuyou, “…?”
Years later, Lu Wuyou became the Prime Minister, holding the highest position among officials, wielding immense power across the land, and reflecting on the past.
A student asked him how he had come this far.
Prime Minister Lu thought to himself that as long as one marries a wife of extraordinary beauty, often coveted by others, it would always inspire one to strive to make progress.

It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.
But what happened to her in the end?

Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.
Who knew he’d be reborn again…

From a young age, Rubel was called a saint due to her bond with the spirits and her immense magical prowess, drafted into countless battlefields. Yet when peace was finally achieved, her reward was an annulled engagement to the prince and a royal command: oversee the haunted Forest of Death, teeming with monstrous beasts, and marry the so-called “Barbarian Count,” a margrave of the frontier.
The Barbarian Count was said to be a man who spent his days battling monstrous creatures, obsessed with wealth, and reputed to be so terrifying in appearance that a mere glance could make someone faint.
But Rubel thought, Isn’t this a chance to fulfill my long-held dream of owning my own home?
After punching the prince goodbye, she set off alone for her final task, armed with just her staff and a single trunk, to wed the margrave of the frontier.
However, what awaited her was not the monstrous figure she had expected, but a breathtakingly handsome man with a villainous look that could make anyone weak at the knees.
What was meant to be a marriage in name only soon proved otherwise—her husband was kind, his domain awe-inspiring, and...]]></description>

"Are you an omega?"
Why is he asking if I'm an omega?
Jaemin, who is not good at his job and lacks awareness, but is kind, becomes a cleaner on the day of the interview. The next day when Jaemin goes to the dentist's office, he stutters at the cold tone of Lee Hyun, which is different from yesterday.
"I'm a cleaner... part-time job. Temporary work. Three hours a day, twenty thousand won per hour."
"I told you this morning. The newly hired cleaning part-timer is so cute."
"Oh. Cleaning."
The only difference in appearance is the presence or absence of glasses between the twin brothers Ihyun and Ichan. Jaemin, unaware that he has fallen into their trap, works diligently, but soon realizes that something is wrong.
"I want to go home. Please let me go."

"Ajin, you can't leave this room until you've paid off all your debts." Now, this room became Ajin's world, yet he found solace in the fact that Seokju didn't abandon him.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[*This story contains themes of coercive relationships and uncomfortable subjects.
A child was on the way.
We loved each other, were happy together, and dreamed of a future as a family.
But on the way to the obstetrician to meet the baby, an unexpected accident occurred.
Due to the accident, Dokwon didn't open his eyes for a long time, and when he finally came to...
"Omega?"
He didn't remember me.
But I was okay. We loved each other more than anything. I believed without a doubt that we could return to that time.
Dokwon's words hurt, but I could endure it. I could bear it.
"You'll regret this."
"Me? What will I regret?"
"Talking to me like that."
"What?"
"Treating me poorly. Treating me like a gold digger. Seeing me as an empty-headed omega who only emits pheromones. You'll regret it later."
But the world relentlessly pushed us to the edge.
And finally,
"Let's end this here."
"...What?"
"Get rid of the baby."
"...What did you say?"
"Let's end this without causing any more disgrace. Eunsoo Yoo."
The end tore us apart.
Left standing alone at the end... I fervently wished for death.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA["Every day, a recurring hellish dream. Junseong is stuck in a world that feels like an endless loop, much like a roguelike game. It's a cursed world where he struggles every day. Two months have passed since he set foot in the zombie apocalypse world in his dreams. "Ha...." As soon as he woke up, his gaze was instinctively drawn to the internet broadcast that he habitually left on. -A major riot is occurring in some regions due to the current situation... Then, beep! A loud sound announcing a disaster alert echoed in Junseong's head. Unconsciously picking up his phone along with the alarm sound, Junseong couldn't hide his confused expression.
[10:44 AM] It was the exact time he had always woken up in his dream. Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. "I've been wanting to ask you something."
"What?" As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo's gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. "Why do you look at me like that?" Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. "How am I... looking at you?"
"...." Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the 'fake smile' he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of blood was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of blood from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his 'clothes' but emanated from him.``]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Jeong Yeo-won wakes up from a frozen state.
When I opened my eyes, I found myself woke up 500 years later in a world that had already been destroyed.
A monster suddenly appears from the gate.
'Esper', a godlike creature who has awakened his powers follow its lead.
And the world is completely different from the past. Humans are no longer the masters of the Earth.
The Espers, who are supposed to hunt monsters and protect the city, are actually leading the world to further destruction due to their rampage. The 'Guides' that could calm the Espers have already disappeared.
But then.
"I'm a guide?"
The only guide who miraculously woke up in a discarded hibernation capsule.
Yeo-won creates a guiding drug that slows down the rampage and distributes it around the world.
Thus, the world is one step away from destruction,
but now she must protect herself from the espers who seek to find and possess the guide.
A drop of water that falls on dry land,
Will it be able to moisten the earth, or will it dry up and disappear in the heat.]]></description>

"...Ah, I got it right this time? Yeah, I'll use this for my fiancé. What of it?" Ian's voice continued soothingly. "Even if I just torment him a little, that young master will run off crying to his daddy. If he's an alpha, he might even be traumatized."
In this world, is this a dream or reality? Is my fiancé now buying adult toys from my favorite club just to torment me? That sounded far more alluring and sweet than any love confession Noah had ever heard. Noah immediately changed the resolve he had just made to not marry Ian Miller. Someone who would even pluck a star from the sky for him is nothing special, and someone who hates him is nothing special either, but someone who will torment him is most welcome. This marriage must happen! It absolutely must! The delusion and love between a lovable, cute masochist and a lone, serious bad guy!]]></description>

Han's simple daily life working part-time at a convenience store is suddenly turned upside down.
"Your debt amounts to a total of one hundred million and seven thousand."
With a timid and fearful personality, Han is unwittingly drawn into the world of the 'Tasenda' club to repay the massive debt he incurred. There, he meets Jang Taesin, a man who is a perfect fit for the depths of darkness.
From the moment Taesin laid eyes on Han, he was inexplicably drawn to him and began to obsessively pursue him, offering a proposal to keep him from escaping.
"I'll stay by your side only until I get tired of you. Once I'm tired of your body, I'll consider your debt paid and let you go."
"How long will it take for you to get tired of me?"
"About twenty times, and I won't get tired."
However, instead of getting tired, the thirst only grew stronger.
He wanted to see, touch, and possess him. Once he had his body, he found himself desiring his heart as well.
"Why don't I ever get to see that cheap smile of yours?"
"You'll never see me smile in front of you, even if I die."
Taesin couldn't understand why Han hated him so much, and Han couldn't fathom Taesin's obsession with him.
Thus, the tangled threads of a complex relationship began to weave between the two, as distant from the end of the world as they could be. Can these two people, who seem so far apart from the rest of the world, really be together?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">불가혼 means incompatible. In the prospects of matrimony, it means unmarriageable.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summary–</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kang Yeon-hong, the noble daughter of Minister Kang, is no longer the cherished young lady she once was, her aristocratic status now a mere facade. One day, she is abducted and sold to the renowned noble, Kwon Gu-yong, in Hanyang, under the condition that she rears a child for the prestigious Kwon family.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Facing a humiliating fate, she attempts to escape, only to be stopped by a man who resembles an old lover, holding her tightly. This was the man who once loved her with his life, the one who supposedly died during the tragic fall of his household.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The man shook his head in annoyance. It seemed like he was disinterested in her petty grievances, clicking his tongue, as if in contempt. His gaze darkened with disdain.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I don’t know who you think I am, let me make one thing clear."</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">He pried her hands away and spoke.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I’ve never met a woman like you."</span></i>
&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Character Guide</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Male Lead: Heo Nan-woo</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A guest and a resident at the household of Minister Kang</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Despite his lowly social status, he was taken in as a guest and a master of Go</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to his innate genius at the game. Having lived a life devoid of desires, he’s met with a fatal crisis when he begins to covet Young Lady</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Yeon-hong. </span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After five years, he is reborn in Hanyang (present-day Seoul) as Kwon Si-gyeong, the eldest son of one of the most prestigious families in the capital. He had confidence that he had completely forgotten his past, but it was mere arrogance. What lingered could be a thirst for revenge or a tangled mix of love and hatred.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Female Lead: Kang Yeon-hong</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A cherished noble lady who was raised like a precious gem. Strong-willed and stubborn, she’s always had her way. Having lived a life of luxury, she suddenly finds herself agonising over an intense longing for a lowly household guest — without even realizing it could be love.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the happiest moment of her life, she loses everything. As she writhes in one hell, another abyss beckons her.</span>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Hate me all you want. I will never let you go. Never."</span></i>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A story of love, hatred, and revenge that transcends social status.</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatable quotes: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Even a dog doesn’t bite the hand that raised it. How much more so should a person repay kindness?"</span></i>]]></description>

These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand.

A paranoid young man with a gloomy expression: "Nuan Nuan, you're not allowed to go anywhere except by my side..."
The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."
Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...

      <description><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Synopsis: </span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lin Yuran never would have thought that the client sitting across from her, forcing them both to work together, was the high school classmate she had rejected long ago, Chi Ye.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The two maintained a distant yet courteous relationship, keeping their distance as they worked together.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Lin Yuran gradually felt something wasn't quite right.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, why did this man insist on her working at his company instead of her own studio? And moreover, how come her office just so happened to be directly opposite his?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another instance, when Lin Yuran accepted a ride in another man's Rolls-Royce Phantom, Chi Ye only sighed, "I thought I'd never get to ride a luxury car like this in my life."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The very next day, Chi Ye's car changed to a Bentley, then Bugatti, followed by Koenigsegg... Another time, Lin Yuran accidentally stumbled upon Chi Ye's Baidu profile and discovered that her favorite lollipop factory was registered under his name.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">But rumor had it that the factory closed five years ago, and that some mysterious big shot loved eating these lollipops, so he bought the factory and continued production regardless of profit or loss, no matter what the situation.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous clues led Lin Yuran to suspect—</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Chi Ye still liked her?</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Little did she know, even their second encounter was part of his plan.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Chi Ye remained unaware that on that sweltering afternoon six years ago, Lin Yuran had quietly watched his lonely figure from afar and murmured softly, "If we meet again someday, I hope I can respond to you."</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That year, only the wind heard her confession.</span>]]></description>

Li Suimei knew that Qin Qing would disdain to attend her engagement ceremony with Qin Zhan.
After all, as a vicious female supporting character, Li Suimei’s role as a stepping stone for the male and female leads was almost over.
Why would Qin Qing come to help her?
Li Suimei chuckled bitterly. She had heard rumors about Qin Qing being very protective of her loved ones, but she didn't know who had spread those rumors.
——At the engagement ceremony, Qin Qing, who was originally not supposed to attend, suddenly appeared. Wearing a snow-white wedding dress, she stood in the position that should have belonged to the male protagonist and said expressionlessly,
"Now, you are my wife."
Li Suimei: "..."
Didn't this person seem indifferent towards her just yesterday?
••••
Small Theater:
Qin Qing pinched Li Suimei's wrist, her gaze fierce, "Back then, I always thought, you invited me to dinner and movies, stayed up late with me to go through documents, hugged my arm and cried, calling me 'sister.' Whenever I got angry, you would get nervous, and you even walked in and out of my room in your pajamas. If that wasn't love, what was it?"
Li Suimei looked confused, "When did I bent?"

      <description><![CDATA[Lin Chu, an engineering student, was following a novel and found the villain character especially compelling. When she read the part where the villain was forced to marry a manipulative woman during his downfall, Lin Chu couldn’t help but criticize the green tea character.
Who would have expected that she’d black out, only to become that very same troublesome woman who regretted her marriage to the villain on their wedding day and ultimately got herself killed?
Lin Chu: “…”
Stay calm, don’t panic.
Looking at the villainous husband, injured and returning from the battlefield, Lin Chu thought she had found her chance to escape her tragic fate by clinging to his leg for survival…

The little blind girl was so angry that she took out chili powder and sprayed it all over, then turned around and ran. She was completely lost and was almost hit by a car. One of the delinquents rushed over and hugged her, pointed at her and scolding in a loud voice, “Are you blind! Why did you run onto the road!”
&nbsp;
Yes, she was blind. The little blind girl burst into tears, her throat choking up, and the soft cloth on her eyes slipped off.

The delinquent boy looked straight at her, “F*ck me?”

“Let go… of me.” The little blind girl struggled against him.

The delinquent boy looked at her pretty face and gulped, “What’s your name? Tell me, and I’ll let you go.”

“…S-Su Ruan.” The little blind girl cried.

“F*ck…” The delinquent boy l**ked the tip of his teeth and looked down at the tent in his pants. His voice had even become a little hoarse. “What a coincidence. My name is Hella Hard.”]]></description>

      <title>After Marrying the Disabled Prince (BG)</title>
      <chaptername>Chapter 8: Reap What You Sow</chaptername>
      <nameextend/>
      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/after-marrying-the-disabled-prince/chapter-8-reap-what-you-sow/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[The fourth prince, Pei Yuan, was convicted overnight, falling from the title of the infamous King of Jibei to a paralyzed cripple.
The Duke of Rong’s household was unwilling to marry off their legitimate daughter, so the unloved Bao Ning was sent as a substitute bride.
The fourth prince's residence was nothing more than a broken-down courtyard on the capital's outskirts, covered in cobwebs and deserted. Pei Yuan, with a crippled leg, lay on the bed, filthy all over, glaring at her coldly with eyes full of vigilance and disgust.
Bao Ning, however, was delighted. Here, there were no scheming sisters or harsh mistresses. She could do whatever she wanted—raising chickens, planting vegetables and the two could live well enough.
As for this seemingly difficult-to-get-along-with disabled husband...
Bao Ning squatted beside Pei Yuan with a bowl of rice, looking at him eagerly. “I gave you all the meat. You should be a little nicer to me.”
In the struggle for the throne, the brothers turned against each other, and in one scheme, Pei Yuan was severely injured.
When he lay in bed with a crippled leg, he thought his life was over.
Unexpectedly, his newly married little wife suddenly broke into his life, fragrant and smiling, like a beam of light piercing through the mist.
How could he bear to only treat her a little better?
At their wedding, the dowry consisted of only three sacks of millet. Now, he offers the kingdom itself, just to make her smile.
<strong>Main characters:</strong> Ji Bao Ning and Pei Yuan
<strong>Warnings:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>The female lead is gentle and cute, skilled in cooking and crafting, with no scheming, and not a "strong woman" type.</li>
 	<li>The male lead can recover.</li>
 	<li>The male lead has a rugged, bandit-like personality, not a gentle-type prince.</li>

      <title>After Rebirth, I Married my Archenemy</title>

      <nameextend>I must escort Lady Qing back to the palace for interrogation</nameextend>
      <link>https://dragonholic.com/novel/after-rebirth-i-married-my-archenemy/volume-1-bird-in-cage/chapter-68/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.
After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor's chest: "Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?"
The new emperor kissed her: "You will be fine, just love me."
The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: "Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left."
When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess's obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official's wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.
Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.
------
The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.
Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.
For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, "The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated," before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. Blood poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.
When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.
Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: "Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?"
"... She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore."
Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: "She said she won't fight, so the fight is over?"

From a young age, Rubel was called a saint due to her bond with the spirits and her immense magical prowess, drafted into countless battlefields. Yet when peace was finally achieved, her reward was an annulled engagement to the prince and a royal command: oversee the haunted Forest of Death, teeming with monstrous beasts, and marry the so-called “Barbarian Count,” a margrave of the frontier.
The Barbarian Count was said to be a man who spent his days battling monstrous creatures, obsessed with wealth, and reputed to be so terrifying in appearance that a mere glance could make someone faint.
But Rubel thought, Isn’t this a chance to fulfill my long-held dream of owning my own home?
After punching the prince goodbye, she set off alone for her final task, armed with just her staff and a single trunk, to wed the margrave of the frontier.
However, what awaited her was not the monstrous figure she had expected, but a breathtakingly handsome man with a villainous look that could make anyone weak at the knees.
What was meant to be a marriage in name only soon proved otherwise—her husband was kind, his domain awe-inspiring, and...]]></description>

In this world where magic reigns supreme, there's a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a 'stud' in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<strong>This work contains themes of gaslighting, coercion, and other morally challenging topics. Please be aware of this when engaging with the story.</strong>
---
The orphanage, engulfed in flames, was the only home Yeo-reum had ever known. Even as the fire raged, Yeo-reum ran back inside, desperate to find the director, only to encounter two unfamiliar brothers.
“Help… please, help me…”
“Call someone. They just left a kid behind.”
“But with a face like that, it’d be a waste.”
When Yeo-reum woke up, he found himself in the brothers’ home, unsure if he had been rescued or kidnapped. With nowhere else to go, he came to see them as his saviors and began a new life.
The concept of "family" felt foreign and complicated to Yeo-reum. But as he lived with the brothers, he slowly redefined what family meant, pouring his unwavering affection into them—unaware that his devotion only fueled their underlying unease. As time passed, their relationship grew into something inexplicably intense and tangled.

      <description><![CDATA[The man I had a drunken one-night stand with turned out to be the male lead from the original story. The issue? This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.
No! I don't want you to express it with your body either!]]></description>

When her fiancé announces their engagement is over with a flippant, "Sorry, Katrina, but I've found my true love," Katrina is left stunned. 
Not only is the reason for their split obvious infidelity, but she's forced to endure the smug expressions of her ex-fiancé and his so-called "soulmate," along with the curious and judgmental stares of everyone around her.
The sheer absurdity of it all is more than Katrina’s frail body can handle, sending her into a fit of sharp stomach pains that ultimately push her to her limits. The ones who cornered her like this should be prepared to face the consequences!
This version keeps the original plot points but adds a bit more emphasis on Katrina's own dramatic resolve amidst her health struggles.]]></description>

      <title>After Rebirth, I Married my Archenemy</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.
After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor's chest: "Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?"
The new emperor kissed her: "You will be fine, just love me."
The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: "Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left."
When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess's obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official's wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.
Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.
------
The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.
Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.
For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, "The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated," before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. Blood poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.
When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.
Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: "Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?"
"... She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore."
Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: "She said she won't fight, so the fight is over?"

      <description><![CDATA["A Marriage in Name Only, Yet 'My Wife' and 'My Husband' Are Too Perfect!"
From a young age, Rubel was called a saint due to her bond with the spirits and her immense magical prowess, drafted into countless battlefields. Yet when peace was finally achieved, her reward was an annulled engagement to the prince and a royal command: oversee the haunted Forest of Death, teeming with monstrous beasts, and marry the so-called “Barbarian Count,” a margrave of the frontier.
The Barbarian Count was said to be a man who spent his days battling monstrous creatures, obsessed with wealth, and reputed to be so terrifying in appearance that a mere glance could make someone faint.
But Rubel thought, Isn’t this a chance to fulfill my long-held dream of owning my own home?
After punching the prince goodbye, she set off alone for her final task, armed with just her staff and a single trunk, to wed the margrave of the frontier.
However, what awaited her was not the monstrous figure she had expected, but a breathtakingly handsome man with a villainous look that could make anyone weak at the knees.
What was meant to be a marriage in name only soon proved otherwise—her husband was kind, his domain awe-inspiring, and...]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[After drinking too much at my retirement celebration, I woke up to find myself inexplicably transformed into a beautiful young boy in another world. In this world where magic reigns supreme, there's a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a 'stud' in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Jiang Jingchun, who was the cherished daughter of a minister’s household, grew up as a true pampered young miss. She could have whatever she desired, except for one thing: her cousin, Gu Huaisheng, the young marquis of a marquis’ residence.
Gu Huaisheng, who was the son of a marquis’ household, was like snow on the eaves or the moon outside the window—elegant, untouchable, and the most outstanding young man in his family. He was far beyond anyone’s reach.
Jiang Jingchun tried everything to win his favour. She found out the type of person he seemed to admire and transformed herself from an outspoken and willful young lady into someone obedient and meek in his presence.
Yet no matter how hard she tried, Gu Huaisheng would barely spare her a glance.
The frustrated and desperate Jiang Jingchun followed a terrible idea from her closest friend. One day, while he wasn’t paying attention, she leaned in to kiss his cheek. But just as she moved closer, Gu Huaisheng turned his head, and their lips accidentally met…
The soft touch of their lips startled her, but before Jiang Jingchun could even blush, Gu Huaisheng shoved her away harshly. With a cold and angry glare, he spat, “Shameless,” and strode away without a backward glance.
That one push left Jiang Jingchun completely stunned and shattered her girlish infatuation into pieces.
<hr />
Misfortunes never come singly. On the same day, news arrived at the minister’s household: the true daughter of their family had been found.
Jiang Jingchun had lived as the family’s treasured daughter for over a decade. Only then did she learn that she was, in fact, a fake daughter.
At the true daughter’s formal recognition banquet, Jiang Jingchun witnessed something that cut deeper than anything before. Gu Huaisheng, who had always been cold and distant to her, now stood before the true daughter and treated her gently and warmly.
He could smile, she realised, but not for her.
From beginning to end, she had been nothing but a colossal joke.
Gu Huaisheng was cruel. She swore she would never like him again.
<hr />
After the true daughter of the Jiang family returned, Jiang Jingchun’s heart turned to ashes. She calmly accepted the marriage that the Jiang family arranged for her.
But before the betrothal was finalised, Gu Huaisheng appeared at her family residence’s doorstep.
On a day of heavy rain, he stood in the downpour under an umbrella, gripping her delicate wrist and refusing to let go. He said, “He is not a good man.”
Jiang Jingchun laughed and shook off his hand. “He is still far kinder than you, Cousin.”
Under Jiang Jingchun’s icy gaze, Gu Huaisheng tensed up. A sharp ache spread through his chest.
For the first time, the proud and aloof young marquis understood what it truly meant to feel regret.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Synopsis:
Wen Zhao transmigrated into a low-magic Xianxia novel, only to discover she'd become the cannon fodder second female lead who bullied the female lead, seduced the male lead, and was generally a green tea b*tch, lotus-flower-like antagonist.
In the original novel, she was the catalyst for misunderstandings between the male and female leads, a dedicated tool character who lived until the grand finale. In the end, the male and female leads ended up together, while she suffered the consequences.
To avoid a bad ending, Wen Zhao tried her best to cling to the female lead without being too out of character, hoping to safely exit the story.
Although she was still being required by the system to perform actions befitting a second female lead, Wen Zhao believed the female lead would eventually understand her sincere heart!
However, it seemed like the female lead was looking at her a bit strangely?
••••
Male Lead: A Zhao, I suddenly realized that I might actually like you a little.
Wen Zhao: ???
She thought this was the biggest deviation from the plot, but then the female lead slowly approached.
Lowering her gaze slightly, the female lead, whose gaze was usually cold, revealed a hint of obsession and possessiveness. She walked up to Wen Zhao and smiled softly.
She asked softly, "A Zhao, between him and me, who do you choose?"
Wen Zhao: I choose you! I choose you!
••••
One-Sentence Summary: Thank you everyone, I'm with the female lead now.
Theme: Even when facing difficulties, one should strive to overcome them and have the determination to reverse their situation. Only through hard work can one achieve success. Victory and new surprises are waiting not far away.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The man I had a drunken one-night stand with turned out to be the male lead from the original story. The issue? This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.
No! I don't want you to express it with your body either!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Ye Yuxi has lived in the interstellar world for 20 years and has just remembered that she is a proud transmigrator. Before her transmigration, she was an avid fan of horror games; after transmigrating, she coincidentally became a university student majoring in game design. In this interstellar world, where everyone is a tough, bloodthirsty warrior, violent and gory games are all the rage—most notably, games about hunting insectoid aliens and zombies. A search across the star network reveals no concept of supernatural horror games at all!
What does this mean? It means there is a vast untapped blue ocean of opportunity!
With this in mind, Ye Yuxi rolls up her sleeves and decides to give the interstellar residents a little shock with horror female ghost!
She launches <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campus Nightmare</span></i>, and interstellar players are terrified: “I’ve never been this scared of school!”
She releases <em>Residential Area Battle Royale</em>, and interstellar players cry: “This isn’t the battle royale I’ve played before!”
She rolls out <em>A Loving Home</em>, and interstellar players go crazy: “Where’s my quilt barrier? Is there any safe place in this world?!”
Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”
Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”

Later, after receiving the 10,086th complaint message from a terrified player, Ye Yuxi calmly accepts an interview: “At first, I just wanted to make a small game I’d enjoy. I never expected it to be so popular, so I ended up making a few more…”
Players who were scared out of their wits: “We thank you!”

      <description><![CDATA[Gu Yu Qi, a daughter born to a marquis household. She was beautiful with knowledge in both civil and military, and her kindness broader than the sky. It was love at first sight for her, and she insisted on marrying him and was happy even if she were to become a mistress. She worked hard to help him step by step to become the emperor.
But what happened to her in the end?
For ten whole years, she was humiliated and abandoned. Disheartened, she drank poison to end her life and set her place on fire, only to find herself back to when she was ten years old. It was the year she followed her mother into the capital. It wasn’t too late to change her fate.
If Yun Ke had any regrets in his previous life, then it would be how he always kept thinking about a woman who died decades ago. Because of that, before he died, he secretly had the woman’s ashes pressed beneath his coffin. As the emperor, he had the final say of everything under the sky. So how could he allow that woman to be arrogant in front of him? Even at his deathbed, he would crush her beneath him.
Who knew he’d be reborn again…
When the transmigrated girl meets the boy who was reborn, Gu Yu Qi simply wanted to yell at the sky. Just what are you playing at!?]]></description>

The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."

      <description><![CDATA[Everyone in the capital knew that the Marquess’s wife, Lan Qingxi, was despised by her in-laws, abused by her mother-in-law, and merely a plaything of the treacherous Song Linyuan. People expected her to be divorced, thrown into a pond, and abandoned, ending up in a pitiful state. But one day, when Lan Qingxi was about to leave the Marquess’s residence, Song Linyuan waited at the door, wiping the dust from her shoes, carefully helping her into the bridal sedan, and leading a procession to marry her. That’s when everyone realized they had misjudged the situation.
After their marriage, Song Linyuan said, “Madam, it’s rumored in the capital that I fear my wife.”
Lan Qingxi innocently replied, “Who has the audacity to spread such rumors about the Prime Minister? Drag them out and execute them.”
Song Linyuan: “I did.”
Lan Qingxi: “……”
Lan Qingxi’s saying: Successfully performing in front of a scumbag is called lying. Successfully performing in front of Song Linyuan is called winning at life.

      <description><![CDATA[*This story contains themes of coercive relationships and uncomfortable subjects.
A child was on the way.
We loved each other, were happy together, and dreamed of a future as a family.
But on the way to the obstetrician to meet the baby, an unexpected accident occurred.
Due to the accident, Dokwon didn't open his eyes for a long time, and when he finally came to...
"Omega?"
He didn't remember me.
But I was okay. We loved each other more than anything. I believed without a doubt that we could return to that time.
Dokwon's words hurt, but I could endure it. I could bear it.
"You'll regret this."
"Me? What will I regret?"
"Talking to me like that."
"What?"
"Treating me poorly. Treating me like a gold digger. Seeing me as an empty-headed omega who only emits pheromones. You'll regret it later."
But the world relentlessly pushed us to the edge.
And finally,
"Let's end this here."
"...What?"
"Get rid of the baby."
"...What did you say?"
"Let's end this without causing any more disgrace. Eunsoo Yoo."
The end tore us apart.
Left standing alone at the end... I fervently wished for death.]]></description>

It's a cursed world where he struggles every day. Two months have passed since he set foot in the zombie apocalypse world in his dreams. "Ha...." As soon as he woke up, his gaze was instinctively drawn to the internet broadcast that he habitually left on. -A major riot is occurring in some regions due to the current situation... Then, beep! A loud sound announcing a disaster alert echoed in Junseong's head. Unconsciously picking up his phone along with the alarm sound, Junseong couldn't hide his confused expression.
[10:44 AM] It was the exact time he had always woken up in his dream. Everything was just like his usual dreams. However, a man he had never seen in his dreams before, Do Hanseo, appeared right in front of Junseong. "I've been wanting to ask you something."
"What?" As Junseong was about to reply, he felt a change in Hanseo's gaze. The smile that had been on his lips disappeared. Consequently, Junseong felt a strong, cold, and sharp pressure, as if a dagger was piercing his throat. "Why do you look at me like that?" Feeling the strange pressure, Junseong, who had tightly sealed his lips for a moment, asked instead. "How am I... looking at you?"
"...." Instead of an immediate answer, Hanseo just gazed silently. Then, he showed the 'fake smile' he had been holding onto a little while ago. His clothes were too clean, his body had no wounds, and the smell of blood was so strong in comparison. When he took off his clothes, he could be sure. The scent of blood from the man named Do Hanseo was not from his 'clothes' but emanated from him.``]]></description>

"...Ah, I got it right this time? Yeah, I'll use this for my fiancé. What of it?" Ian's voice continued soothingly. "Even if I just torment him a little, that young master will run off crying to his daddy. If he's an alpha, he might even be traumatized."
In this world, is this a dream or reality? Is my fiancé now buying adult toys from my favorite club just to torment me? That sounded far more alluring and sweet than any love confession Noah had ever heard. Noah immediately changed the resolve he had just made to not marry Ian Miller. Someone who would even pluck a star from the sky for him is nothing special, and someone who hates him is nothing special either, but someone who will torment him is most welcome. This marriage must happen! It absolutely must! The delusion and love between a lovable, cute masochist and a lone, serious bad guy!]]></description>

"Are you an omega?"
Why is he asking if I'm an omega?
Jaemin, who is not good at his job and lacks awareness, but is kind, becomes a cleaner on the day of the interview. The next day when Jaemin goes to the dentist's office, he stutters at the cold tone of Lee Hyun, which is different from yesterday.
"I'm a cleaner... part-time job. Temporary work. Three hours a day, twenty thousand won per hour."
"I told you this morning. The newly hired cleaning part-timer is so cute."
"Oh. Cleaning."
The only difference in appearance is the presence or absence of glasses between the twin brothers Ihyun and Ichan. Jaemin, unaware that he has fallen into their trap, works diligently, but soon realizes that something is wrong.
"I want to go home. Please let me go."

And the world is completely different from the past. Humans are no longer the masters of the Earth.
The Espers, who are supposed to hunt monsters and protect the city, are actually leading the world to further destruction due to their rampage. The 'Guides' that could calm the Espers have already disappeared.
But then.
"I'm a guide?"
The only guide who miraculously woke up in a discarded hibernation capsule.
Yeo-won creates a guiding drug that slows down the rampage and distributes it around the world.
Thus, the world is one step away from destruction,
but now she must protect herself from the espers who seek to find and possess the guide.
A drop of water that falls on dry land,
Will it be able to moisten the earth, or will it dry up and disappear in the heat.]]></description>

Han's simple daily life working part-time at a convenience store is suddenly turned upside down.
"Your debt amounts to a total of one hundred million and seven thousand."
With a timid and fearful personality, Han is unwittingly drawn into the world of the 'Tasenda' club to repay the massive debt he incurred. There, he meets Jang Taesin, a man who is a perfect fit for the depths of darkness.
From the moment Taesin laid eyes on Han, he was inexplicably drawn to him and began to obsessively pursue him, offering a proposal to keep him from escaping.
"I'll stay by your side only until I get tired of you. Once I'm tired of your body, I'll consider your debt paid and let you go."
"How long will it take for you to get tired of me?"
"About twenty times, and I won't get tired."
However, instead of getting tired, the thirst only grew stronger.
He wanted to see, touch, and possess him. Once he had his body, he found himself desiring his heart as well.
"Why don't I ever get to see that cheap smile of yours?"
"You'll never see me smile in front of you, even if I die."
Taesin couldn't understand why Han hated him so much, and Han couldn't fathom Taesin's obsession with him.
Thus, the tangled threads of a complex relationship began to weave between the two, as distant from the end of the world as they could be. Can these two people, who seem so far apart from the rest of the world, really be together?]]></description>

From a young age, Rubel was called a saint due to her bond with the spirits and her immense magical prowess, drafted into countless battlefields. Yet when peace was finally achieved, her reward was an annulled engagement to the prince and a royal command: oversee the haunted Forest of Death, teeming with monstrous beasts, and marry the so-called “Barbarian Count,” a margrave of the frontier.
The Barbarian Count was said to be a man who spent his days battling monstrous creatures, obsessed with wealth, and reputed to be so terrifying in appearance that a mere glance could make someone faint.
But Rubel thought, Isn’t this a chance to fulfill my long-held dream of owning my own home?
After punching the prince goodbye, she set off alone for her final task, armed with just her staff and a single trunk, to wed the margrave of the frontier.
However, what awaited her was not the monstrous figure she had expected, but a breathtakingly handsome man with a villainous look that could make anyone weak at the knees.
What was meant to be a marriage in name only soon proved otherwise—her husband was kind, his domain awe-inspiring, and...]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Before her death, Qun Qing hated the powerful official Lu Huating the most. She hated him for assisting the new emperor and for being cunning and insidious. She thought about him day and night, and tried her best to defeat him, but she was not his match. In the end, she became a cannon fodder in his hands.
After Qun Qing died, she saw the princess of the fallen country that she had protected with her life, crying and leaning on the new emperor's chest: "Qung Qing is dead, what should I do?"
The new emperor kissed her: "You will be fine, just love me."
The princess burst into tears, like a delicate flower under the rain: "Qung Qing is dead, Your Majesty is all I have left."
When she opened his eyes, Qun Qing had woke up three years ago. She stood up, woodenly packed her bags, and regardless of the princess's obstruction, took off her jade crown and walked away, dropped her female official's wooden seal, turned around and left, leaving behind ten years of careful planning and treading on thin ice.
Restore the country? Pfft, restore it my foot.
------
The powerful minister Lu Huating is deeply cunning, ruthless, and dominates the power struggles of the court. Tired of the ugly nature of human hearts, his life has become dull and unfulfilling.
Looking back on his life, the only thing that left an impression was a female officer, a spy, whom he poisoned to death at the age of twenty-six.
For the love of the princess, she sacrificed his life for the country and schemed against him several times. In the end, she knelt in front of the Summer Palace, her facial expression remaining unchanged, with a look of resentment in her eyes, and sighed with a smile, "The king who wins is the ruler, and the one who loses is the defeated," before raising her head and drinking to the last drop. Blood poured from her lips, a thin layer of vivid red.
When he opened his eyes again, Lu Huating returned to his twenty-three-year-old self.
Lu Huating looked at the documents under his command, and felt even more bored. He put down his brush and leaned on the back of the chair: "Where is the female official accompanying Crown Princess?"
"... She resigned. She asked me to tell My lord that she would not fight anymore."
Lu Huating was silent for a while, and curled his lips coldly: "She said she won't fight, so the fight is over?"

Li Suimei knew that Qin Qing would disdain to attend her engagement ceremony with Qin Zhan.
After all, as a vicious female supporting character, Li Suimei’s role as a stepping stone for the male and female leads was almost over.
Why would Qin Qing come to help her?
Li Suimei chuckled bitterly. She had heard rumors about Qin Qing being very protective of her loved ones, but she didn't know who had spread those rumors.
——At the engagement ceremony, Qin Qing, who was originally not supposed to attend, suddenly appeared. Wearing a snow-white wedding dress, she stood in the position that should have belonged to the male protagonist and said expressionlessly,
"Now, you are my wife."
Li Suimei: "..."
Didn't this person seem indifferent towards her just yesterday?

Small Theater:
Qin Qing pinched Li Suimei's wrist, her gaze fierce, "Back then, I always thought, you invited me to dinner and movies, stayed up late with me to go through documents, hugged my arm and cried, calling me 'sister.' Whenever I got angry, you would get nervous, and you even walked in and out of my room in your pajamas. If that wasn't love, what was it?"

      <description><![CDATA[The man I had a drunken one-night stand with turned out to be the male lead from the original story. The issue? This ridiculously rich, handsome, and incredibly fit younger guy is set to start a war in two years. And me? I need to get out of here, obviously. So, I said, "I only liked you for your money."
"Is that so? I have plenty of money. Does that mean you like me a lot, then?" He leaned in, planting a light kiss on my cheek, then asked in a low voice, "Besides the money, what else do you like about me? Yesterday, it seemed like you were quite into my face and body too."
"What?"
"I'm guessing you’re in love with me..."
"Ack!" Instinctively, I screamed to block his love confession. But Kyle, as if he'd just realized something, grinned brightly.
"I get it now, noona. You don’t want to hear me say I love you, right?"
Exactly, that’s it!
"In that case, I’ll express it in a way you like better than words."
With that, Kyle tugged his tie loose and stepped closer to me.
No! I don't want you to express it with your body either!]]></description>

The cold-blooded emperor whose face was stained with blood: "Nuan Nuan, for you, what does it matter if the empire falls?"
The demonized immortal with snow-white hair: "Nuan Nuan, you are my inner demon."
The zombie king of the apocalypse with an unwavering gaze: "Nuan Nuan, it’s your choice—kill me, or save me."

      <description><![CDATA[The fourth prince, Pei Yuan, was convicted overnight, falling from the title of the infamous King of Jibei to a paralyzed cripple.
The Duke of Rong’s household was unwilling to marry off their legitimate daughter, so the unloved Bao Ning was sent as a substitute bride.
The fourth prince's residence was nothing more than a broken-down courtyard on the capital's outskirts, covered in cobwebs and deserted. Pei Yuan, with a crippled leg, lay on the bed, filthy all over, glaring at her coldly with eyes full of vigilance and disgust.
Bao Ning, however, was delighted. Here, there were no scheming sisters or harsh mistresses. She could do whatever she wanted—raising chickens, planting vegetables and the two could live well enough.
As for this seemingly difficult-to-get-along-with disabled husband...
Bao Ning squatted beside Pei Yuan with a bowl of rice, looking at him eagerly. “I gave you all the meat. You should be a little nicer to me.”
In the struggle for the throne, the brothers turned against each other, and in one scheme, Pei Yuan was severely injured.
When he lay in bed with a crippled leg, he thought his life was over.
Unexpectedly, his newly married little wife suddenly broke into his life, fragrant and smiling, like a beam of light piercing through the mist.
How could he bear to only treat her a little better?
At their wedding, the dowry consisted of only three sacks of millet. Now, he offers the kingdom itself, just to make her smile.
<strong>Main characters:</strong> Ji Bao Ning and Pei Yuan
<strong>Warnings:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>The female lead is gentle and cute, skilled in cooking and crafting, with no scheming, and not a "strong woman" type.</li>
 	<li>The male lead can recover.</li>
 	<li>The male lead has a rugged, bandit-like personality, not a gentle-type prince.</li>

When she read the part where the villain was forced to marry a manipulative woman during his downfall, Lin Chu couldn’t help but criticize the green tea character.
Who would have expected that she’d black out, only to become that very same troublesome woman who regretted her marriage to the villain on their wedding day and ultimately got herself killed?

      <description><![CDATA[<strong>This work contains themes of gaslighting, coercion, and other morally challenging topics. Please be aware of this when engaging with the story.</strong>
---
The orphanage, engulfed in flames, was the only home Yeo-reum had ever known. Even as the fire raged, Yeo-reum ran back inside, desperate to find the director, only to encounter two unfamiliar brothers.
“Help… please, help me…”
“Call someone. They just left a kid behind.”
“But with a face like that, it’d be a waste.”
When Yeo-reum woke up, he found himself in the brothers’ home, unsure if he had been rescued or kidnapped. With nowhere else to go, he came to see them as his saviors and began a new life.
The concept of "family" felt foreign and complicated to Yeo-reum. But as he lived with the brothers, he slowly redefined what family meant, pouring his unwavering affection into them—unaware that his devotion only fueled their underlying unease. As time passed, their relationship grew into something inexplicably intense and tangled.

In this world where magic reigns supreme, there's a catch – only women can use magic. The value of men lies in their ability to produce magically powerful offspring, recognized only through the demanding role of a 'stud' in a challenging setting. Somehow, when I engage in procreation, both the children and their mothers gain peculiar powers. Before I knew it, my surroundings were filled with women. Is this some kind of cheat?]]></description>

From a young age, Rubel was called a saint due to her bond with the spirits and her immense magical prowess, drafted into countless battlefields. Yet when peace was finally achieved, her reward was an annulled engagement to the prince and a royal command: oversee the haunted Forest of Death, teeming with monstrous beasts, and marry the so-called “Barbarian Count,” a margrave of the frontier.
The Barbarian Count was said to be a man who spent his days battling monstrous creatures, obsessed with wealth, and reputed to be so terrifying in appearance that a mere glance could make someone faint.
But Rubel thought, Isn’t this a chance to fulfill my long-held dream of owning my own home?
After punching the prince goodbye, she set off alone for her final task, armed with just her staff and a single trunk, to wed the margrave of the frontier.
However, what awaited her was not the monstrous figure she had expected, but a breathtakingly handsome man with a villainous look that could make anyone weak at the knees.

These villains are cold-blooded, obsessive, and ruthless—capable of annihilating millions with a smile and destroying the world with a wave of their hand.

Sheng Nuan became even more panicked...
